Well Prince so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes But I warn you if you dont tell me that this means war if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist  I really believe he is Antichrist  I will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend no longer my faithful slave as you call yourself But how do you do I see I have frightened you  sit down and tell me all the newsIt was in July  and the speaker was the wellknown Anna Pavlovna Scherer maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna With these words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin a man of high rank and importance who was the first to arrive at her reception Anna Pavlovna had had a cough for some days She was as she said suffering from la grippe grippe being then a new word in St Petersburg used only by the eliteAll her invitations without exception written in French and delivered by a scarletliveried footman that morning ran as followsIf you have nothing better to do Count or Prince and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between  and   Annette SchererHeavens what a virulent attack replied the prince not in the least disconcerted by this reception He had just entered wearing an embroidered court uniform knee breeches and shoes and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought and with the gentle patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court He went up to Anna Pavlovna kissed her hand presenting to her his bald scented and shining head and complacently seated himself on the sofaFirst of all dear friend tell me how you are Set your friends mind at rest said he without altering his tone beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discernedCan one be well while suffering morally Can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling said Anna Pavlovna You are staying the whole evening I hopeAnd the fete at the English ambassadors Today is Wednesday I must put in an appearance there said the prince My daughter is coming for me to take me thereI thought todays fete had been canceled I confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisomeIf they had known that you wished it the entertainment would have been put off said the prince who like a woundup clock by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believedDont tease Well and what has been decided about Novosiltsevs dispatch You know everythingWhat can one say about it replied the prince in a cold listless tone What has been decided They have decided that Buonaparte has burnt his boats and I believe that we are ready to burn oursPrince Vasili always spoke languidly like an actor repeating a stale part Anna Pavlovna Scherer on the contrary despite her forty years overflowed with animation and impulsiveness To be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and sometimes even when she did not feel like it she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her The subdued smile which though it did not suit her faded features always played round her lips expressed as in a spoiled child a continual consciousness of her charming defect which she neither wished nor could nor considered it necessary to correctIn the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pavlovna burst outOh dont speak to me of Austria Perhaps I dont understand things but Austria never has wished and does not wish for war She is betraying us Russia alone must save Europe Our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it That is the one thing I have faith in Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth and he is so virtuous and noble that God will not forsake him He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain We alone must avenge the blood of the just one Whom I ask you can we rely on England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexanders loftiness of soul She has refused to evacuate Malta She wanted to find and still seeks some secret motive in our actions What answer did Novosiltsev get None The English have not understood and cannot understand the selfabnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for himself but only desires the good of mankind And what have they promised Nothing And what little they have promised they will not perform Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible and that all Europe is powerless before him And I dont believe a word that Hardenburg says or Haugwitz either This famous Prussian neutrality is just a trap I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch He will save EuropeShe suddenly paused smiling at her own impetuosityI think said the prince with a smile that if you had been sent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King of Prussias consent by assault You are so eloquent Will you give me a cup of teaIn a moment A propos she added becoming calm again I am expecting two very interesting men tonight le Vicomte de Mortemart who is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans one of the best French families He is one of the genuine emigres the good ones And also the Abbe Morio Do you know that profound thinker He has been received by the Emperor Had you heardI shall be delighted to meet them said the prince But tell me he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be appointed first secretary at Vienna The baron by all accounts is a poor creaturePrince Vasili wished to obtain this post for his son but others were trying through the Dowager Empress Marya Fedorovna to secure it for the baronAnna Pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or was pleased withBaron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her sister was all she said in a dry and mournful toneAs she named the Empress Anna Pavlovnas face suddenly assumed an expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with sadness and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious patroness She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funke beaucoup destime and again her face clouded over with sadnessThe prince was silent and looked indifferent But with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her Anna Pavlovna wished both to rebuke him for daring to speak he had done of a man recommended to the Empress and at the same time to console him so she saidNow about your family Do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been enraptured by her They say she is amazingly beautifulThe prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitudeI often think she continued after a short pause drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversation  I often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed Why has fate given you two such splendid children I dont speak of Anatole your youngest I dont like him she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows Two such charming children And really you appreciate them less than anyone and so you dont deserve to have themAnd she smiled her ecstatic smileI cant help it said the prince Lavater would have said I lack the bump of paternityDont joke I mean to have a serious talk with you Do you know I am dissatisfied with your younger son Between ourselves and her face assumed its melancholy expression he was mentioned at Her Majestys and you were pitiedThe prince answered nothing but she looked at him significantly awaiting a reply He frownedWhat would you have me do he said at last You know I did all a father could for their education and they have both turned out fools Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool but Anatole is an active one That is the only difference between them He said this smiling in a way more natural and animated than usual so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasantAnd why are children born to such men as you If you were not a father there would be nothing I could reproach you with said Anna Pavlovna looking up pensivelyI am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my children are the bane of my life It is the cross I have to bear That is how I explain it to myself It cant be helpedHe said no more but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture Anna Pavlovna meditatedHave you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole she asked They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking and though I dont feel that weakness in myself as yetI know a little person who is very unhappy with her father She is a relation of yours Princess Mary BolkonskayaPrince Vasili did not reply though with the quickness of memory and perception befitting a man of the world he indicated by a movement of the head that he was considering this informationDo you know he said at last evidently unable to check the sad current of his thoughts that Anatole is costing me forty thousand rubles a year And he went on after a pause what will it be in five years if he goes on like this Presently he added Thats what we fathers have to put up with Is this princess of yours richHer father is very rich and stingy He lives in the country He is the wellknown Prince Bolkonski who had to retire from the army under the late Emperor and was nicknamed the King of Prussia He is very clever but eccentric and a bore The poor girl is very unhappy She has a brother I think you know him he married Lise Meinen lately He is an aidedecamp of Kutuzovs and will be here tonightListen dear Annette said the prince suddenly taking Anna Pavlovnas hand and for some reason drawing it downwards Arrange that affair for me and I shall always be your most devoted slave  slafe wigh an f as a village elder of mine writes in his reports She is rich and of good family and thats all I wantAnd with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him he raised the maid of honors hand to his lips kissed it and swung it to and fro as he lay back in his armchair looking in another directionAttendez said Anna Pavlovna reflecting Ill speak to Lise young Bolkonskis wife this very evening and perhaps the thing can be arranged It shall be on your familys behalf that Ill start my apprenticeship as old maid CHAPTER II Anna Pavlovnas drawing room was gradually filling The highest Petersburg society was assembled there people differing widely in age and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged Prince Vasilis daughter the beautiful Helene came to take her father to the ambassadors entertainment she wore a ball dress and her badge as maid of honor The youthful little Princess Bolkonskaya known as la femme la plus seduisante de Petersbourg was also there She had been married during the previous winter and being pregnant did not go to any large gatherings but only to small receptions Prince Vasilis son Hippolyte had come with Mortemart whom he introduced The Abbe Morio and many others had also come The most fascinating woman in Petersburg To each new arrival Anna Pavlovna said You have not yet seen my aunt or You do not know my aunt and very gravely conducted him or her to a little old lady wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt Anna Pavlovna mentioned each ones name and then left themEach visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not one of them knew not one of them wanted to know and not one of them cared about Anna Pavlovna observed these greetings with mournful and solemn interest and silent approval The aunt spoke to each of them in the same words about their health and her own and the health of Her Majesty who thank God was better today And each visitor though politeness prevented his showing impatience left the old woman with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not return to her the whole eveningThe young Princess Bolkonskaya had brought some work in a goldembroidered velvet bag Her pretty little upper lip on which a delicate dark down was just perceptible was too short for her teeth but it lifted all the more sweetly and was especially charming when she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip As is always the case with a thoroughly attractive woman her defect  the shortness of her upper lip and her halfopen mouth  seemed to be her own special and peculiar form of beauty Everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty young woman so soon to become a mother so full of life and health and carrying her burden so lightly Old men and dull dispirited young ones who looked at her after being in her company and talking to her a little while felt as if they too were becoming like her full of life and health All who talked to her and at each word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her white teeth thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that dayThe little princess went round the table with quick short swaying steps her workbag on her arm and gaily spreading out her dress sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar as if all she was doing was a pleasure to herself and to all around her I have brought my work said she in French displaying her bag and addressing all present Mind Annette I hope you have not played a wicked trick on me she added turning to her hostess You wrote that it was to be quite a small reception and just see how badly I am dressed And she spread out her arms to show her shortwaisted lacetrimmed dainty gray dress girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breastSoyez tranquille Lise you will always be prettier than anyone else replied Anna PavlovnaYou know said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in French turning to a general my husband is deserting me He is going to get himself killed Tell me what this wretched war is for she added addressing Prince Vasili and without waiting for an answer she turned to speak to his daughter the beautiful HeleneWhat a delightful woman this little princess is said Prince Vasili to Anna PavlovnaOne of the next arrivals was a stout heavily built young man with closecropped hair spectacles the lightcolored breeches fashionable at that time a very high ruffle and a brown dress coat This stout young man was an illegitimate son of Count Bezukhov a wellknown grandee of Catherines time who now lay dying in Moscow The young man had not yet entered either the military or civil service as he had only just returned from abroad where he had been educated and this was his first appearance in society Anna Pavlovna greeted him with the nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room But in spite of this lowestgrade greeting a look of anxiety and fear as at the sight of something too large and unsuited to the place came over her face when she saw Pierre enter Though he was certainly rather bigger than the other men in the room her anxiety could only have reference to the clever though shy but observant and natural expression which distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing roomIt is very good of you Monsieur Pierre to come and visit a poor invalid said Anna Pavlovna exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt as she conducted him to herPierre murmured something unintelligible and continued to look round as if in search of something On his way to the aunt he bowed to the little princess with a pleased smile as to an intimate acquaintanceAnna Pavlovnas alarm was justified for Pierre turned away from the aunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majestys health Anna Pavlovna in dismay detained him with the words Do you know the Abbe Morio He is a most interesting manYes I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace and it is very interesting but hardly feasibleYou think so rejoined Anna Pavlovna in order to say something and get away to attend to her duties as hostess But Pierre now committed a reverse act of impoliteness First he had left a lady before she had finished speaking to him and now he continued to speak to another who wished to get away With his head bent and his big feet spread apart he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbes plan chimericalWe will talk of it later said Anna Pavlovna with a smileAnd having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch ready to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag As the foreman of a spinning mill when he has set the hands to work goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should and hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion so Anna Pavlovna moved about her drawing room approaching now a silent now a toonoisy group and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady proper and regular motion But amid these cares her anxiety about Pierre was evident She kept an anxious watch on him when he approached the group round Mortemart to listen to what was being said there and again when he passed to another group whose center was the abbePierre had been educated abroad and this reception at Anna Pavlovnas was the first he had attended in Russia He knew that all the intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and like a child in a toyshop did not know which way to look afraid of missing any clever conversation that was to be heard Seeing the selfconfident and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting to hear something very profound At last he came up to Morio Here the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own views as young people are fond of doing CHAPTER III Anna Pavlovnas reception was in full swing The spindles hummed steadily and ceaselessly on all sides With the exception of the aunt beside whom sat only one elderly lady who with her thin careworn face was rather out of place in this brilliant society the whole company had settled into three groups One chiefly masculine had formed round the abbe Another of young people was grouped round the beautiful Princess Helene Prince Vasilis daughter and the little Princess Bolkonskaya very pretty and rosy though rather too plump for her age The third group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna PavlovnaThe vicomte was a nicelooking young man with soft features and polished manners who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in which he found himself Anna Pavlovna was obviously serving him up as a treat to her guests As a clever maitre dhotel serves up as a specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in the kitchen would have cared to eat so Anna Pavlovna served up to her guests first the vicomte and then the abbe as peculiarly choice morsels The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing the murder of the Duc dEnghien The vicomte said that the Duc dEnghien had perished by his own magnanimity and that there were particular reasons for Buonapartes hatred of himAh yes Do tell us all about it Vicomte said Anna Pavlovna with a pleasant feeling that there was something a la Louis XV in the sound of that sentence Contez nous cela VicomteThe vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to comply Anna Pavlovna arranged a group round him inviting everyone to listen to his taleThe vicomte knew the duc personally whispered Anna Pavlovna to of the guests The vicomte is a wonderful raconteur said she to another How evidently he belongs to the best society said she to a third and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest and most advantageous style like a wellgarnished joint of roast beef on a hot dishThe vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smileCome over here Helene dear said Anna Pavlovna to the beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off the center of another groupThe princess smiled She rose with the same unchanging smile with which she had first entered the room  the smile of a perfectly beautiful woman With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss and ivy with a gleam of white shoulders glossy hair and sparkling diamonds she passed between the men who made way for her not looking at any of them but smiling on all as if graciously allowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders back and bosom  which in the fashion of those days were very much exposed  and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she moved toward Anna Pavlovna Helene was so lovely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry but on the contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty She seemed to wish but to be unable to diminish its effectHow lovely said everyone who saw her and the vicomte lifted his shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her unchanging smileMadame I doubt my ability before such an audience said he smilingly inclining his headThe princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered a reply unnecessary She smilingly waited All the time the story was being told she sat upright glancing now at her beautiful round arm altered in shape by its pressure on the table now at her still more beautiful bosom on which she readjusted a diamond necklace From time to time she smoothed the folds of her dress and whenever the story produced an effect she glanced at Anna Pavlovna at once adopted just the expression she saw on the maid of honors face and again relapsed into her radiant smileThe little princess had also left the tea table and followed HeleneWait a moment Ill get my work Now then what are you thinking of she went on turning to Prince Hippolyte Fetch me my workbagThere was a general movement as the princess smiling and talking merrily to everyone at once sat down and gaily arranged herself in her seatNow I am all right she said and asking the vicomte to begin she took up her workPrince Hippolyte having brought the workbag joined the circle and moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside herLe charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance to his beautiful sister but yet more by the fact that in spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly His features were like his sisters but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous selfsatisfied youthful and constant smile of animation and by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure his face on the contrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen selfconfidence while his body was thin and weak His eyes nose and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant wearied grimace and his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positionsIts not going to be a ghost story said he sitting down beside the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette as if without this instrument he could not begin to speakWhy no my dear fellow said the astonished narrator shrugging his shouldersBecause I hate ghost stories said Prince Hippolyte in a tone which showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he had uttered themHe spoke with such selfconfidence that his hearers could not be sure whether what he said was very witty or very stupid He was dressed in a darkgreen dress coat knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe effrayee as he called it shoes and silk stockingsThe vicomte told his tale very neatly It was an anecdote then current to the effect that the Duc dEnghien had gone secretly to Paris to visit Mademoiselle George that at her house he came upon Bonaparte who also enjoyed the famous actress favors and that in his presence Napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was subject and was thus at the ducs mercy The latter spared him and this magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by deathThe story was very pretty and interesting especially at the point where the rivals suddenly recognized one another and the ladies looked agitatedCharming said Anna Pavlovna with an inquiring glance at the little princessCharming whispered the little princess sticking the needle into her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story prevented her from going on with itThe vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully prepared to continue but just then Anna Pavlovna who had kept a watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her noticed that he was talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbe so she hurried to the rescue Pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbe about the balance of power and the latter evidently interested by the young mans simpleminded eagerness was explaining his pet theory Both were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally which was why Anna Pavlovna disapprovedThe means are the balance of power in Europe and the rights of the people the abbe was saying It is only necessary for one powerful nation like Russia  barbaric as she is said to be  to place herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object the maintenance of the balance of power of Europe and it would save the worldBut how are you to get that balance Pierre was beginningAt that moment Anna Pavlovna came up and looking severely at Pierre asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate The Italians face instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected sugary expression evidently habitual to him when conversing with womenI am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the society more especially of the feminine society in which I have had the honor of being received that I have not yet had time to think of the climate said heNot letting the abbe and Pierre escape Anna Pavlovna the more conveniently to keep them under observation brought them into the larger circle CHAPTER IV Just them another visitor entered the drawing room Prince Andrew Bolkonski the little princess husband He was a very handsome young man of medium height with firm clearcut features Everything about him from his weary bored expression to his quiet measured step offered a most striking contrast to his quiet little wife It was evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room but had found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to them And among all these faces that he found so tedious none seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife He turned away from her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face kissed Anna Pavlovnas hand and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole companyYou are off to the war Prince said Anna PavlovnaGeneral Kutuzov said Bolkonski speaking French and stressing the last syllable of the generals name like a Frenchman has been pleased to take me as an aidedecampAnd Lise your wifeShe will go to the countryAre you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wifeAndre said his wife addressing her husband in the same coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men the vicomte has been telling us such a tale about Mademoiselle George and BuonapartePrince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away Pierre who from the moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with glad affectionate eyes now came up and took his arm Before he looked round Prince Andrew frowned again expressing his annoyance with whoever was touching his arm but when he saw Pierres beaming face he gave him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smileThere now So you too are in the great world said he to PierreI knew you would be here replied Pierre I will come to supper with you May I he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the vicomte who was continuing his storyNo impossible said Prince Andrew laughing and pressing Pierres hand to show that there was no need to ask the question He wished to say something more but at that moment Prince Vasili and his daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them passYou must excuse me dear Vicomte said Prince Vasili to the Frenchman holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent his rising This unfortunate fete at the ambassadors deprives me of a pleasure and obliges me to interrupt you I am very sorry to leave your enchanting party said he turning to Anna PavlovnaHis daughter Princess Helene passed between the chairs lightly holding up the folds of her dress and the smile shone still more radiantly on her beautiful face Pierre gazed at her with rapturous almost frightened eyes as she passed himVery lovely said Prince AndrewVery said PierreIn passing Prince Vasili seized Pierres hand and said to Anna Pavlovna Educate this bear for me He has been staying with me a whole month and this is the first time I have seen him in society Nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever women Anna Pavlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand She knew his father to be a connection of Prince Vasilis The elderly lady who had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook Prince Vasili in the anteroom All the affectation of interest she had assumed had left her kindly and tearworn face and it now expressed only anxiety and fearHow about my son Boris Prince said she hurrying after him into the anteroom I cant remain any longer in Petersburg Tell me what news I may take back to my poor boyAlthough Prince Vasili listened reluctantly and not very politely to the elderly lady even betraying some impatience she gave him an ingratiating and appealing smile and took his hand that he might not go awayWhat would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor and then he would be transferred to the Guards at once said sheBelieve me Princess I am ready to do all I can answered Prince Vasili but it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor I should advise you to appeal to Rumyantsev through Prince Golitsyn That would be the best wayThe elderly lady was a Princess Drubetskaya belonging to one of the best families in Russia but she was poor and having long been out of society had lost her former influential connections She had now come to Petersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her only son It was in fact solely to meet Prince Vasili that she had obtained an invitation to Anna Pavlovnas reception and had sat listening to the vicomtes story Prince Vasilis words frightened her an embittered look clouded her once handsome face but only for a moment then she smiled again and dutched Prince Vasilis arm more tightlyListen to me Prince said she I have never yet asked you for anything and I never will again nor have I ever reminded you of my fathers friendship for you but now I entreat you for Gods sake to do this for my son  and I shall always regard you as a benefactor she added hurriedly No dont be angry but promise I have asked Golitsyn and he has refused Be the kindhearted man you always were she said trying to smile though tears were in her eyesPapa we shall be late said Princess Helene turning her beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she stood waiting by the doorInfluence in society however is a capital which has to be economized if it is to last Prince Vasili knew this and having once realized that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him he would soon be unable to ask for himself he became chary of using his influence But in Princess Drubetskayas case he felt after her second appeal something like qualms of conscience She had reminded him of what was quite true he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his career Moreover he could see by her manners that she was one of those women  mostly mothers  who having once made up their minds will not rest until they have gained their end and are prepared if necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour and even to make scenes This last consideration moved himMy dear Anna Mikhaylovna said he with his usual familiarity and weariness of tone it is almost impossible for me to do what you ask but to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your fathers memory I will do the impossible  your son shall be transferred to the Guards Here is my hand on it Are you satisfiedMy dear benefactor This is what I expected from you  I knew your kindness He turned to goWait  just a word When he has been transferred to the Guards she faltered You are on good terms with Michael Ilarionovich Kutuzov recommend Boris to him as adjutant Then I shall be at rest and thenPrince Vasili smiledNo I wont promise that You dont know how Kutuzov is pestered since his appointment as Commander in Chief He told me himself that all the Moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as adjutantsNo but do promise I wont let you go My dear benefactorPapa said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before we shall be lateWell au revoir Goodby You hear herThen tomorrow you will speak to the EmperorCertainly but about Kutuzov I dont promiseDo promise do promise Vasili cried Anna Mikhaylovna as he went with the smile of a coquettish girl which at one time probably came naturally to her but was now very illsuited to her careworn faceApparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed all the old feminine arts But as soon as the prince had gone her face resumed its former cold artificial expression She returned to the group where the vicomte was still talking and again pretended to listen while waiting till it would be time to leave Her task was accomplished CHAPTER V And what do you think of this latest comedy the coronation at Milan asked Anna Pavlovna and of the comedy of the people of Genoa and Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte and Monsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the nations Adorable It is enough to make ones head whirl It is as if the whole world had gone crazyPrince Andrew looked Anna Pavlovna straight in the face with a sarcastic smileDieu me la donne gare a qui la touche They say he was very fine when he said that he remarked repeating the words in Italian Dio mi lha dato Guai a chi la tocchi God has given it to me let him who touches it beware I hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run over Anna Pavlovna continued The sovereigns will not be able to endure this man who is a menace to everythingThe sovereigns I do not speak of Russia said the vicomte polite but hopeless The sovereigns madame What have they done for Louis XVII for the Queen or for Madame Elizabeth Nothing and he became more animated And believe me they are reaping the reward of their betrayal of the Bourbon cause The sovereigns Why they are sending ambassadors to compliment the usurperAnd sighing disdainfully he again changed his positionPrince Hippolyte who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time through his lorgnette suddenly turned completely round toward the little princess and having asked for a needle began tracing the Conde coat of arms on the table He explained this to her with as much gravity as if she had asked him to do itBaton de gueules engrele de gueules d azur  maison Conde said heThe princess listened smilingIf Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer the vicomte continued with the air of a man who in a matter with which he is better acquainted than anyone else does not listen to others but follows the current of his own thoughts things will have gone too far By intrigues violence exile and executions French society  I mean good French society  will have been forever destroyed and thenHe shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands Pierre wished to make a remark for the conversation interested him but Anna Pavlovna who had him under observation interruptedThe Emperor Alexander said she with the melancholy which always accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family has declared that he will leave it to the French people themselves to choose their own form of government and I believe that once free from the usurper the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms of its rightful king she concluded trying to be amiable to the royalist emigrantThat is doubtful said Prince Andrew Monsieur le Vicomte quite rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far I think it will be difficult to return to the old regimeFrom what I have heard said Pierre blushing and breaking into the conversation almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to Bonapartes sideIt is the Buonapartists who say that replied the vicomte without looking at Pierre At the present time it is difficult to know the real state of French public opinionBonaparte has said so remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcastic smileIt was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his remarks at him though without looking at himI showed them the path to glory but they did not follow it Prince Andrew continued after a short silence again quoting Napoleons words I opened my antechambers and they crowded in I do not know how far he was justified in saying soNot in the least replied the vicomte After the murder of the duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero If to some people he went on turning to Anna Pavlovna he ever was a hero after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one hero less on earthBefore Anna Pavlovna and the others had time to smile their appreciation of the vicomtes epigram Pierre again broke into the conversation and though Anna Pavlovna felt sure he would say something inappropriate she was unable to stop himThe execution of the Duc dEnghien declared Monsieur Pierre was a political necessity and it seems to me that Napoleon showed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole responsibility of that deedDieu Mon Dieu muttered Anna Pavlovna in a terrified whisperWhat Monsieur Pierre Do you consider that assassination shows greatness of soul said the little princess smiling and drawing her work nearer to herOh Oh exclaimed several voicesCapital said Prince Hippolyte in English and began slapping his knee with the palm of his handThe vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders Pierre looked solemnly at his audience over his spectacles and continuedI say so he continued desperately because the Bourbons fled from the Revolution leaving the people to anarchy and Napoleon alone understood the Revolution and quelled it and so for the general good he could not stop short for the sake of one mans lifeWont you come over to the other table suggested Anna PavlovnaBut Pierre continued his speech without heeding herNo cried he becoming more and more eager Napoleon is great because he rose superior to the Revolution suppressed its abuses preserved all that was good in it  equality of citizenship and freedom of speech and of the press  and only for that reason did he obtain powerYes if having obtained power without availing himself of it to commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king I should have called him a great man remarked the vicomteHe could not do that The people only gave him power that he might rid them of the Bourbons and because they saw that he was a great man The Revolution was a grand thing continued Monsieur Pierre betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme youth and his wish to express all that was in his mindWhat Revolution and regicide a grand thing Well after that But wont you come to this other table repeated Anna PavlovnaRousseaus Contrat social said the vicomte with a tolerant smileI am not speaking of regicide I am speaking about ideasYes ideas of robbery murder and regicide again interjected an ironical voiceThose were extremes no doubt but they are not what is most important What is important are the rights of man emancipation from prejudices and equality of citizenship and all these ideas Napoleon has retained in full forceLiberty and equality said the vicomte contemptuously as if at last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words were highsounding words which have long been discredited Who does not love liberty and equality Even our Saviour preached liberty and equality Have people since the Revolution become happier On the contrary We wanted liberty but Buonaparte has destroyed itPrince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre to the vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess In the first moment of Pierres outburst Anna Pavlovna despite her social experience was horrorstruck But when she saw that Pierres sacrilegious words had not exasperated the vicomte and had convinced herself that it was impossible to stop him she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in a vigorous attack on the oratorBut my dear Monsieur Pierre said she how do you explain the fact of a great man executing a duc  or even an ordinary man who  is innocent and untriedI should like said the vicomte to ask how monsieur explains the th Brumaire was not that an imposture It was a swindle and not at all like the conduct of a great manAnd the prisoners he killed in Africa That was horrible said the little princess shrugging her shouldersHes a low fellow say what you will remarked Prince HippolytePierre not knowing whom to answer looked at them all and smiled His smile was unlike the halfsmile of other people When he smiled his grave even rather gloomy look was instantaneously replaced by another  a childlike kindly even rather silly look which seemed to ask forgivenessThe vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that this young Jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested All were silentHow do you expect him to answer you all at once said Prince Andrew Besides in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish between his acts as a private person as a general and as an emperor So it seems to meYes yes of course Pierre chimed in pleased at the arrival of this reinforcementOne must admit continued Prince Andrew that Napoleon as a man was great on the bridge of Arcola and in the hospital at Jaffa where he gave his hand to the plaguestricken but but there are other acts which it is difficult to justifyPrince Andrew who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of Pierres remarks rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to go Suddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend and asking them all to be seated beganI was told a charming Moscow story today and must treat you to it Excuse me Vicomte  I must tell it in Russian or the point will be lost And Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in such Russian as a Frenchman would speak after spending about a year in Russia Everyone waited so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their attention to his storyThere is in Moscow a lady une dame and she is very stingy She must have two footmen behind her carriage and very big ones That was her taste And she had a ladys maid also big She saidHere Prince Hippolyte paused evidently collecting his ideas with difficultyShe said Oh yes She said Girl to the maid put on a livery get up behind the carriage and come with me while I make some callsHere Prince Hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his audience which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator Several persons among them the elderly lady and Anna Pavlovna did however smileShe went Suddenly there was a great wind The girl lost her hat and her long hair came down Here he could contain himself no longer and went on between gasps of laughter And the whole world knewAnd so the anecdote ended Though it was unintelligible why he had told it or why it had to be told in Russian still Anna Pavlovna and the others appreciated Prince Hippolytes social tact in so agreeably ending Pierres unpleasant and unamiable outburst After the anecdote the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last and next balls about theatricals and who would meet whom and when and where CHAPTER VI Having thanked Anna Pavlovna for her charming soiree the guests began to take their leavePierre was ungainly Stout about the average height broad with huge red hands he did not know as the saying is to enter a drawing room and still less how to leave one that is how to say something particularly agreeable before going away Besides this he was absentminded When he rose to go he took up instead of his own the generals threecornered hat and held it pulling at the plume till the general asked him to restore it All his absentmindedness and inability to enter a room and converse in it was however redeemed by his kindly simple and modest expression Anna Pavlovna turned toward him and with a Christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion nodded and said I hope to see you again but I also hope you will change your opinions my dear Monsieur PierreWhen she said this he did not reply and only bowed but again everybody saw his smile which said nothing unless perhaps Opinions are opinions but you see what a capital goodnatured fellow I am And everyone including Anna Pavlovna felt thisPrince Andrew had gone out into the hall and turning his shoulders to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak listened indifferently to his wifes chatter with Prince Hippolyte who had also come into the hall Prince Hippolyte stood close to the pretty pregnant princess and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglassGo in Annette or you will catch cold said the little princess taking leave of Anna Pavlovna It is settled she added in a low voiceAnna Pavlovna had already managed to speak to Lise about the match she contemplated between Anatole and the little princess sisterinlawI rely on you my dear said Anna Pavlovna also in a low tone Write to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter Au revoir  and she left the hallPrince Hippolyte approached the little princess and bending his face close to her began to whisper somethingTwo footmen the princess and his own stood holding a shawl and a cloak waiting for the conversation to finish They listened to the French sentences which to them were meaningless with an air of understanding but not wishing to appear to do so The princess as usual spoke smilingly and listened with a laughI am very glad I did not go to the ambassadors said Prince Hippolyte so dull It has been a delightful evening has it not DelightfulThey say the ball will be very good replied the princess drawing up her downy little lip All the pretty women in society will be thereNot all for you will not be there not all said Prince Hippolyte smiling joyfully and snatching the shawl from the footman whom he even pushed aside he began wrapping it round the princess Either from awkwardness or intentionally no one could have said which after the shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time as though embracing herStill smiling she gracefully moved away turning and glancing at her husband Prince Andrews eyes were closed so weary and sleepy did he seemAre you ready he asked his wife looking past herPrince Hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak which in the latest fashion reached to his very heels and stumbling in it ran out into the porch following the princess whom a footman was helping into the carriagePrincesse au revoir cried he stumbling with his tongue as well as with his feetThe princess picking up her dress was taking her seat in the dark carriage her husband was adjusting his saber Prince Hippolyte under pretense of helping was in everyones wayAllow me sir said Prince Andrew in Russian in a cold disagreeable tone to Prince Hippolyte who was blocking his pathI am expecting you Pierre said the same voice but gently and affectionatelyThe postilion started the carriage wheels rattled Prince Hippolyte laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte whom he had promised to take homeWell mon cher said the vicomte having seated himself beside Hippolyte in the carriage your little princess is very nice very nice indeed quite French and he kissed the tips of his fingers Hippolyte burst out laughingDo you know you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs continued the vicomte I pity the poor husband that little officer who gives himself the airs of a monarchHippolyte spluttered again and amid his laughter said And you were saying that the Russian ladies are not equal to the French One has to know how to deal with them Pierre reaching the house first went into Prince Andrews study like one quite at home and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa took from the shelf the first book that came to his hand it was Caesars Commentaries and resting on his elbow began reading it in the middleWhat have you done to Mlle Scherer She will be quite ill now said Prince Andrew as he entered the study rubbing his small white handsPierre turned his whole body making the sofa creak He lifted his eager face to Prince Andrew smiled and waved his handThat abbe is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the right light In my opinion perpetual peace is possible but  I do not know how to express it not by a balance of political powerIt was evident that Prince Andrew was not interested in such abstract conversationOne cant everywhere say all one thinks mon cher Well have you at last decided on anything Are you going to be a guardsman or a diplomatist asked Prince Andrew after a momentary silencePierre sat up on the sofa with his legs tucked under himReally I dont yet know I dont like either the one or the otherBut you must decide on something Your father expects itPierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbe as tutor and had remained away till he was twenty When he returned to Moscow his father dismissed the abbe and said to the young man Now go to Petersburg look round and choose your profession I will agree to anything Here is a letter to Prince Vasili and here is money Write to me all about it and I will help you in everything Pierre had already been choosing a career for three months and had not decided on anything It was about this choice that Prince Andrew was speaking Pierre rubbed his foreheadBut he must be a Freemason said he referring to the abbe whom he had met that eveningThat is all nonsense Prince Andrew again interrupted him let us talk business Have you been to the Horse GuardsNo I have not but this is what I have been thinking and wanted to tell you There is a war now against Napoleon If it were a war for freedom I could understand it and should be the first to enter the army but to help England and Austria against the greatest man in the world is not rightPrince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at Pierres childish words He put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other answer than the one Prince Andrew gave to this naive questionIf no one fought except on his own conviction there would be no wars he saidAnd that would be splendid said PierrePrince Andrew smiled ironicallyVery likely it would be splendid but it will never come aboutWell why are you going to the war asked PierreWhat for I dont know I must Besides that I am going He paused I am going because the life I am leading here does not suit me CHAPTER VII The rustle of a womans dress was heard in the next room Prince Andrew shook himself as if waking up and his face assumed the look it had had in Anna Pavlovnas drawing room Pierre removed his feet from the sofa The princess came in She had changed her gown for a house dress as fresh and elegant as the other Prince Andrew rose and politely placed a chair for herHow is it she began as usual in French settling down briskly and fussily in the easy chair how is it Annette never got married How stupid you men all are not to have married her Excuse me for saying so but you have no sense about women What an argumentative fellow you are Monsieur PierreAnd I am still arguing with your husband I cant understand why he wants to go to the war replied Pierre addressing the princess with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their intercourse with young womenThe princess started Evidently Pierres words touched her to the quickAh that is just what I tell him said she I dont understand it I dont in the least understand why men cant live without wars How is it that we women dont want anything of the kind dont need it Now you shall judge between us I always tell him Here he is Uncles aidedecamp a most brilliant position He is so well known so much appreciated by everyone The other day at the Apraksins I heard a lady asking Is that the famous Prince Andrew I did indeed She laughed He is so well received everywhere He might easily become aidedecamp to the Emperor You know the Emperor spoke to him most graciously Annette and I were speaking of how to arrange it What do you thinkPierre looked at his friend and noticing that he did not like the conversation gave no replyWhen are you starting he askedOh dont speak of his going dont I wont hear it spoken of said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had spoken to Hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly illsuited to the family circle of which Pierre was almost a member Today when I remembered that all these delightful associations must be broken off and then you know Andre she looked significantly at her husband Im afraid Im afraid she whispered and a shudder ran down her backHer husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides Pierre and himself was in the room and addressed her in a tone of frigid politenessWhat is it you are afraid of Lise I dont understand said heThere what egotists men all are all all egotists Just for a whim of his own goodness only knows why he leaves me and locks me up alone in the countryWith my father and sister remember said Prince Andrew gentlyAlone all the same without my friends And he expects me not to be afraidHer tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up giving her not a joyful but an animal squirrellike expression She paused as if she felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before Pierre though the gist of the matter lay in thatI still cant understand what you are afraid of said Prince Andrew slowly not taking his eyes off his wifeThe princess blushed and raised her arms with a gesture of despairNo Andrew I must say you have changed Oh how you haveYour doctor tells you to go to bed earlier said Prince Andrew You had better goThe princess said nothing but suddenly her short downy lip quivered Prince Andrew rose shrugged his shoulders and walked about the roomPierre looked over his spectacles with naive surprise now at him and now at her moved as if about to rise too but changed his mindWhy should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here exclaimed the little princess suddenly her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful grimace I have long wanted to ask you Andrew why you have changed so to me What have I done to you You are going to the war and have no pity for me Why is itLise was all Prince Andrew said But that one word expressed an entreaty a threat and above all conviction that she would herself regret her words But she went on hurriedlyYou treat me like an invalid or a child I see it all Did you behave like that six months agoLise I beg you to desist said Prince Andrew still more emphaticallyPierre who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to all this rose and approached the princess He seemed unable to bear the sight of tears and was ready to cry himselfCalm yourself Princess It seems so to you because I assure you I myself have experienced and so because No excuse me An outsider is out of place here No dont distress yourself GoodbyPrince Andrew caught him by the handNo wait Pierre The princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of the pleasure of spending the evening with youNo he thinks only of himself muttered the princess without restraining her angry tearsLise said Prince Andrew dryly raising his voice to the pitch which indicates that patience is exhaustedSuddenly the angry squirrellike expression of the princess pretty face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear Her beautiful eyes glanced askance at her husbands face and her own assumed the timid deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its drooping tailMon Dieu mon Dieu she muttered and lifting her dress with one hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the foreheadGood night Lise said he rising and courteously kissing her hand as he would have done to a stranger CHAPTER VIII The friends were silent Neither cared to begin talking Pierre continually glanced at Prince Andrew Prince Andrew rubbed his forehead with his small handLet us go and have supper he said with a sigh going to the doorThey entered the elegant newly decorated and luxurious dining room Everything from the table napkins to the silver china and glass bore that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married Halfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the table and with a look of nervous agitation such as Pierre had never before seen on his face began to talk  as one who has long had something on his mind and suddenly determines to speak outNever never marry my dear fellow Thats my advice never marry till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her plainly as she is or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable mistake Marry when you are old and good for nothing  or all that is good and noble in you will be lost It will all be wasted on trifles Yes Yes Yes Dont look at me with such surprise If you marry expecting anything from yourself in the future you will feel at every step that for you all is ended all is closed except the drawing room where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an idiot But whats the good and he waved his armPierre took off his spectacles which made his face seem different and the goodnatured expression still more apparent and gazed at his friend in amazementMy wife continued Prince Andrew is an excellent woman one of those rare women with whom a mans honor is safe but O God what would I not give now to be unmarried You are the first and only one to whom I mention this because I like youAs he said this Prince Andrew was less than ever like that Bolkonski who had lolled in Anna Pavlovnas easy chairs and with halfclosed eyes had uttered French phrases between his teeth Every muscle of his thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement his eyes in which the fire of life had seemed extinguished now flashed with brilliant light It was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times the more impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid irritationYou dont understand why I say this he continued but it is the whole story of life You talk of Bonaparte and his career said he though Pierre had not mentioned Bonaparte but Bonaparte when he worked went step by step toward his goal He was free he had nothing but his aim to consider and he reached it But tie yourself up with a woman and like a chained convict you lose all freedom And all you have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with regret Drawing rooms gossip balls vanity and triviality  these are the enchanted circle I cannot escape from I am now going to the war the greatest war there ever was and I know nothing and am fit for nothing I am very amiable and have a caustic wit continued Prince Andrew and at Anna Pavlovnas they listen to me And that stupid set without whom my wife cannot exist and those women If you only knew what those society women are and women in general My father is right Selfish vain stupid trivial in everything  thats what women are when you see them in their true colors When you meet them in society it seems as if there were something in them but theres nothing nothing nothing No dont marry my dear fellow dont marry concluded Prince AndrewIt seems funny to me said Pierre that you you should consider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life You have everything before you everything And youHe did not finish his sentence but his tone showed how highly he thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the futureHow can he talk like that thought Pierre He considered his friend a model of perfection because Prince Andrew possessed in the highest degree just the very qualities Pierre lacked and which might be best described as strength of will Pierre was always astonished at Prince Andrews calm manner of treating everybody his extraordinary memory his extensive reading he had read everything knew everything and had an opinion about everything but above all at his capacity for work and study And if Pierre was often struck by Andrews lack of capacity for philosophical meditation to which he himself was particularly addicted he regarded even this not as a defect but as a sign of strengthEven in the best most friendly and simplest relations of life praise and commendation are essential just as grease is necessary to wheels that they may run smoothlyMy part is played out said Prince Andrew Whats the use of talking about me Let us talk about you he added after a silence smiling at his reassuring thoughtsThat smile was immediately reflected on Pierres faceBut what is there to say about me said Pierre his face relaxing into a careless merry smile What am I An illegitimate son He suddenly blushed crimson and it was plain that he had made a great effort to say this Without a name and without means And it really But he did not say what it really was For the present I am free and am all right Only I havent the least idea what I am to do I wanted to consult you seriouslyPrince Andrew looked kindly at him yet his glance  friendly and affectionate as it was  expressed a sense of his own superiorityI am fond of you especially as you are the one live man among our whole set Yes youre all right Choose what you will its all the same Youll be all right anywhere But look here give up visiting those Kuragins and leading that sort of life It suits you so badly  all this debauchery dissipation and the rest of itWhat would you have my dear fellow answered Pierre shrugging his shoulders Women my dear fellow womenI dont understand it replied Prince Andrew Women who are comme il faut thats a different matter but the Kuragins set of women women and wine I dont understandPierre was staying at Prince Vasili Kuragins and sharing the dissipated life of his son Anatole the son whom they were planning to reform by marrying him to Prince Andrews sisterDo you know said Pierre as if suddenly struck by a happy thought seriously I have long been thinking of it Leading such a life I cant decide or think properly about anything Ones head aches and one spends all ones money He asked me for tonight but I wont goYou give me your word of honor not to goOn my honor CHAPTER IX It was past one oclock when Pierre left his friend It was a cloudless northern summer night Pierre took an open cab intending to drive straight home But the nearer he drew to the house the more he felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night It was light enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning or evening than night On the way Pierre remembered that Anatole Kuragin was expecting the usual set for cards that evening after which there was generally a drinking bout finishing with visits of a kind Pierre was very fond ofI should like to go to Kuragins thought heBut he immediately recalled his promise to Prince Andrew not to go there Then as happens to people of weak character he desired so passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to that he decided to go The thought immediately occurred to him that his promise to Prince Andrew was of no account because before he gave it he had already promised Prince Anatole to come to his gathering besides thought he all such words of honor are conventional things with no definite meaning especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all the same Pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort nullifying all his decisions and intentions He went to KuraginsReaching the large house near the Horse Guards barracks in which Anatole lived Pierre entered the lighted porch ascended the stairs and went in at the open door There was no one in the anteroom empty bottles cloaks and overshoes were lying about there was a smell of alcohol and sounds of voices and shouting in the distanceCards and supper were over but the visitors had not yet dispersed Pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room in which were the remains of supper A footman thinking no one saw him was drinking on the sly what was left in the glasses From the third room came sounds of laughter the shouting of familiar voices the growling of a bear and general commotion Some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously round an open window Three others were romping with a young bear one pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the othersI bet a hundred on Stevens shouted oneMind no holding on cried anotherI bet on Dolokhov cried a third Kuragin you part our handsThere leave Bruin alone heres a bet onAt one draught or he loses shouted a fourthJacob bring a bottle shouted the host a tall handsome fellow who stood in the midst of the group without a coat and with his fine linen shirt unfastened in front Wait a bit you fellows Here is Petya Good man cried he addressing PierreAnother voice from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober ring cried from the window Come here part the bets This was Dolokhov an officer of the Semenov regiment a notorious gambler and duelist who was living with Anatole Pierre smiled looking about him merrilyI dont understand Whats it all aboutWait a bit he is not drunk yet A bottle here said Anatole taking a glass from the table he went up to PierreFirst of all you must drinkPierre drank one glass after another looking from under his brows at the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window and listening to their chatter Anatole kept on refilling Pierres glass while explaining that Dolokhov was betting with Stevens an English naval officer that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge of the third floor window with his legs hanging outGo on you must drink it all said Anatole giving Pierre the last glass or I wont let you goNo I wont said Pierre pushing Anatole aside and he went up to the windowDolokhov was holding the Englishmans hand and clearly and distinctly repeating the terms of the bet addressing himself particularly to Anatole and PierreDolokhov was of medium height with curly hair and lightblue eyes He was about twentyfive Like all infantry officers he wore no mustache so that his mouth the most striking feature of his face was clearly seen The lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved The middle of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm lower one and something like two distinct smiles played continually round the two corners of the mouth this together with the resolute insolent intelligence of his eyes produced an effect which made it impossible not to notice his face Dolokhov was a man of small means and no connections Yet though Anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles Dolokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a footing that all who knew them including Anatole himself respected him more than they did Anatole Dolokhov could play all games and nearly always won However much he drank he never lost his clearheadedness Both Kuragin and Dolokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces of PetersburgThe bottle of rum was brought The window frame which prevented anyone from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen who were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of the gentlemen aroundAnatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window He wanted to smash something Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame but could not move it He smashed a paneYou have a try Hercules said he turning to PierrePierre seized the crossbeam tugged and wrenched the oak frame out with a crashTake it right out or theyll think Im holding on said DolokhovIs the Englishman bragging Eh Is it all right said AnatoleFirstrate said Pierre looking at Dolokhov who with a bottle of rum in his hand was approaching the window from which the light of the sky the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset was visibleDolokhov the bottle of rum still in his hand jumped onto the window sill Listen cried he standing there and addressing those in the room All were silentI bet fifty imperials  he spoke French that the Englishman might understand him but he did not speak it very well  I bet fifty imperials or do you wish to make it a hundred added he addressing the EnglishmanNo fifty replied the latterAll right Fifty imperials that I will drink a whole bottle of rum without taking it from my mouth sitting outside the window on this spot he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window and without holding on to anything Is that rightQuite right said the EnglishmanAnatole turned to the Englishman and taking him by one of the buttons of his coat and looking down at him  the Englishman was short  began repeating the terms of the wager to him in EnglishWait cried Dolokhov hammering with the bottle on the window sill to attract attention Wait a bit Kuragin Listen If anyone else does the same I will pay him a hundred imperials Do you understandThe Englishman nodded but gave no indication whether he intended to accept this challenge or not Anatole did not release him and though he kept nodding to show that he understood Anatole went on translating Dolokhovs words into English A thin young lad an hussar of the Life Guards who had been losing that evening climbed on the window sill leaned over and looked downOh Oh Oh he muttered looking down from the window at the stones of the pavementShut up cried Dolokhov pushing him away from the window The lad jumped awkwardly back into the room tripping over his spursPlacing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily Dolokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered his legs Pressing against both sides of the window he adjusted himself on his seat lowered his hands moved a little to the right and then to the left and took up the bottle Anatole brought two candles and placed them on the window sill though it was already quite light Dolokhovs back in his white shirt and his curly head were lit up from both sides Everyone crowded to the window the Englishman in front Pierre stood smiling but silent One man older than the others present suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted to seize hold of Dolokhovs shirtI say this is folly Hell be killed said this more sensible manAnatole stopped himDont touch him Youll startle him and then hell be killed Eh What then EhDolokhov turned round and again holding on with both hands arranged himself on his seatIf anyone comes meddling again said he emitting the words separately through his thin compressed lips I will throw him down there Now thenSaying this he again turned round dropped his hands took the bottle and lifted it to his lips threw back his head and raised his free hand to balance himself One of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the window and from Dolokhovs back Anatole stood erect with staring eyes The Englishman looked on sideways pursing up his lips The man who had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw himself on a sofa with his face to the wall Pierre hid his face from which a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed horror and fear All were still Pierre took his hands from his eyes Dolokhov still sat in the same position only his head was thrown further back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar and the hand holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the effort The bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head tilting yet further back Why is it so long thought Pierre It seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed Suddenly Dolokhov made a backward movement with his spine and his arm trembled nervously this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping ledge As he began slipping down his head and arm wavered still more with the strain One hand moved as if to clutch the window sill but refrained from touching it Pierre again covered his eyes and thought he would never never them again Suddenly he was aware of a stir all around He looked up Dolokhov was standing on the window sill with a pale but radiant faceIts emptyHe threw the bottle to the Englishman who caught it neatly Dolokhov jumped down He smelt strongly of rumWell done Fine fellow Theres a bet for you Devil take you came from different sidesThe Englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money Dolokhov stood frowning and did not speak Pierre jumped upon the window sillGentlemen who wishes to bet with me Ill do the same thing he suddenly cried Even without a bet there Tell them to bring me a bottle Ill do it Bring a bottleLet him do it let him do it said Dolokhov smilingWhat next Have you gone mad No one would let you Why you go giddy even on a staircase exclaimed several voicesIll drink it Lets have a bottle of rum shouted Pierre banging the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb out of the windowThey seized him by his arms but he was so strong that everyone who touched him was sent flyingNo youll never manage him that way said Anatole Wait a bit and Ill get round him Listen Ill take your bet tomorrow but now we are all going to sCome on then cried Pierre Come on And well take Bruin with usAnd he caught the bear took it in his arms lifted it from the ground and began dancing round the room with it CHAPTER X Prince Vasili kept the promise he had given to Princess Drubetskaya who had spoken to him on behalf of her only son Boris on the evening of Anna Pavlovnas soiree The matter was mentioned to the Emperor an exception made and Boris transferred into the regiment of Semenov Guards with the rank of cornet He received however no appointment to Kutuzovs staff despite all Anna Mikhaylovnas endeavors and entreaties Soon after Anna Pavlovnas reception Anna Mikhaylovna returned to Moscow and went straight to her rich relations the Rostovs with whom she stayed when in the town and where and where her darling Bory who had only just entered a regiment of the line and was being at once transferred to the Guards as a cornet had been educated from childhood and lived for years at a time The Guards had already left Petersburg on the tenth of August and her son who had remained in Moscow for his equipment was to join them on the march to RadzivilovIt was St Natalias day and the name day of two of the Rostovs  the mother and the youngest daughter  both named Nataly Ever since the morning carriages with six horses had been coming and going continually bringing visitors to the Countess Rostovas big house on the Povarskaya so well known to all Moscow The countess herself and her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawingroom with the visitors who came to congratulate and who constantly succeeded one another in relaysThe countess was a woman of about fortyfive with a thin Oriental type of face evidently worn out with childbearing  she had had twelve A languor of motion and speech resulting from weakness gave her a distinguished air which inspired respect Princess Anna Mikhaylovna Drubetskaya who as a member of the household was also seated in the drawing room helped to receive and entertain the visitors The young people were in one of the inner rooms not considering it necessary to take part in receiving the visitors The count met the guests and saw them off inviting them all to dinnerI am very very grateful to you mon cher or ma chere  he called everyone without exception and without the slightest variation in his tone my dear whether they were above or below him in rank  I thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name day we are keeping But mind you come to dinner or I shall be offended ma chere On behalf of the whole family I beg you to come mon cher These words he repeated to everyone without exception or variation and with the same expression on his full cheerful cleanshaven face the same firm pressure of the hand and the same quick repeated bows As soon as he had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were still in the drawing room drew a chair toward him or her and jauntily spreading out his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air of a man who enjoys life and knows how to live he swayed to and fro with dignity offered surmises about the weather or touched on questions of health sometimes in Russian and sometimes in very bad but selfconfident French then again like a man weary but unflinching in the fulfillment of duty he rose to see some visitors off and stroking his scanty gray hairs over his bald patch also asked them to dinner Sometimes on his way back from the anteroom he would pass through the conservatory and pantry into the large marble dining hall where tables were being set out for eighty people and looking at the footmen who were bringing in silver and china moving tables and unfolding damask table linen he would call Dmitri Vasilevich a man of good family and the manager of all his affairs and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table would say Well Dmitri youll see that things are all as they should be Thats right The great thing is the serving thats it And with a complacent sigh he would return to the drawing roomMarya Lvovna Karagina and her daughter announced the countess gigantic footman in his bass voice entering the drawing room The countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with her husbands portrait on itIm quite worn out by these callers However Ill see her and no more She is so affected Ask her in she said to the footman in a sad voice as if saying Very well finish me offA tall stout and proudlooking woman with a roundfaced smiling daughter entered the drawing room their dresses rustlingDear Countess what an age She has been laid up poor child at the Razumovskis ball and Countess Apraksina I was so delighted came the sounds of animated feminine voices interrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and the scraping of chairs Then one of those conversations began which last out until at the first pause the guests rise with a rustle of dresses and say I am so delighted Mammas health and Countess Apraksina and then again rustling pass into the anteroom put on cloaks or mantles and drive away The conversation was on the chief topic of the day the illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of Catherines day Count Bezukhov and about his illegitimate son Pierre the one who had behaved so improperly at Anna Pavlovnas receptionI am so sorry for the poor count said the visitor He is in such bad health and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill himWhat is that asked the countess as if she did not know what the visitor alluded to though she had already heard about the cause of Count Bezukhovs distress some fifteen timesThats what comes of a modern education exclaimed the visitor It seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as he liked now in Petersburg I hear he has been doing such terrible things that he has been expelled by the policeYou dont say so replied the countessHe chose his friends badly interposed Anna Mikhaylovna Prince Vasilis son he and a certain Dolokhov have it is said been up to heaven only knows what And they have had to suffer for it Dolokhov has been degraded to the ranks and Bezukhovs son sent back to Moscow Anatole Kuragins father managed somehow to get his sons affair hushed up but even he was ordered out of PetersburgBut what have they been up to asked the countessThey are regular brigands especially Dolokhov replied the visitor He is a son of Marya Ivanovna Dolokhova such a worthy woman but there just fancy Those three got hold of a bear somewhere put it in a carriage and set off with it to visit some actresses The police tried to interfere and what did the young men do They tied a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear into the Moyka Canal And there was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his backWhat a nice figure the policeman must have cut my dear shouted the count dying with laughterOh how dreadful How can you laugh at it CountYet the ladies themselves could not help laughingIt was all they could do to rescue the poor man continued the visitor And to think it is Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhovs son who amuses himself in this sensible manner And he was said to be so well educated and clever This is all that his foreign education has done for him I hope that here in Moscow no one will receive him in spite of his money They wanted to introduce him to me but I quite declined I have my daughters to considerWhy do you say this young man is so rich asked the countess turning away from the girls who at once assumed an air of inattention His children are all illegitimate I think Pierre also is illegitimateThe visitor made a gesture with her handI should think he has a score of themPrincess Anna Mikhaylovna intervened in the conversation evidently wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in societyThe fact of the matter is said she significantly and also in a half whisper everyone knows Count Cyrils reputation He has lost count of his children but this Pierre was his favoriteHow handsome the old man still was only a year ago remarked the countess I have never seen a handsomer manHe is very much altered now said Anna Mikhaylovna Well as I was saying Prince Vasili is the next heir through his wife but the count is very fond of Pierre looked after his education and wrote to the Emperor about him so that in the case of his death  and he is so ill that he may die at any moment and Dr Lorrain has come from Petersburg  no one knows who will inherit his immense fortune Pierre or Prince Vasili Forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles I know it all very well for Prince Vasili told me himself Besides Cyril Vladimirovich is my mothers second cousin Hes also my Borys godfather she added as if she attached no importance at all to the factPrince Vasili arrived in Moscow yesterday I hear he has come on some inspection business remarked the visitorYes but between ourselves said the princess that is a pretext The fact is he has come to see Count Cyril Vladimirovich hearing how ill he isBut do you know my dear that was a capital joke said the count and seeing that the elder visitor was not listening he turned to the young ladies I can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman cutAnd as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman his portly form again shook with a deep ringing laugh the laugh of one who always eats well and in particular drinks well So do come and dine with us he said CHAPTER XI Silence ensued The countess looked at her callers smiling affably but not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they now rose and took their leave The visitors daughter was already smoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother when suddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls running to the door and the noise of a chair falling over and a girl of thirteen hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock darted in and stopped short in the middle of the room It was evident that she had not intended her flight to bring her so far Behind her in the doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat collar an officer of the Guards a girl of fifteen and a plump rosyfaced boy in a short jacketThe count jumped up and swaying from side to side spread his arms wide and threw them round the little girl who had run inAh here she is he exclaimed laughing My pet whose name day it is My dear petMa chere there is a time for everything said the countess with feigned severity You spoil her Ilya she added turning to her husbandHow do you do my dear I wish you many happy returns of your name day said the visitor What a charming child she added addressing the motherThis blackeyed widemouthed girl not pretty but full of life  with childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her bodice with black curls tossed backward thin bare arms little legs in lacefrilled drawers and feet in low slippers  was just at that charming age when a girl is no longer a child though the child is not yet a young woman Escaping from her father she ran to hide her flushed face in the lace of her mothers mantilla  not paying the least attention to her severe remark  and began to laugh She laughed and in fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she produced from the folds of her frockDo you see My doll Mimi You see was all Natasha managed to utter to her everything seemed funny She leaned against her mother and burst into such a loud ringing fit of laughter that even the prim visitor could not help joining inNow then go away and take your monstrosity with you said the mother pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness and turning to the visitor she added She is my youngest girlNatasha raising her face for a moment from her mothers mantilla glanced up at her through tears of laughter and again hid her faceThe visitor compelled to look on at this family scene thought it necessary to take some part in itTell me my dear said she to Natasha is Mimi a relation of yours A daughter I supposeNatasha did not like the visitors tone of condescension to childish things She did not reply but looked at her seriouslyMeanwhile the younger generation Boris the officer Anna Mikhaylovnas son Nicholas the undergraduate the counts eldest son Sonya the counts fifteenyearold niece and little Petya his youngest boy had all settled down in the drawing room and were obviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement and mirth that shone in all their faces Evidently in the back rooms from which they had dashed out so impetuously the conversation had been more amusing than the drawingroom talk of society scandals the weather and Countess Apraksina Now and then they glanced at one another hardly able to suppress their laughterThe two young men the student and the officer friends from childhood were of the same age and both handsome fellows though not alike Boris was tall and fair and his calm and handsome face had regular delicate features Nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression Dark hairs were already showing on his upper lip and his whole face expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm Nicholas blushed when he entered the drawing room He evidently tried to find something to say but failed Boris on the contrary at once found his footing and related quietly and humorously how he had know that doll Mimi when she was still quite a young lady before her nose was broken how she had aged during the five years he had known her and how her head had cracked right across the skull Having said this he glanced at Natasha She turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother who was screwing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter and unable to control herself any longer she jumped up and rushed from the room as fast as her nimble little feet would carry her Boris did not laughYou were meaning to go out werent you Mamma Do you want the carriage he asked his mother with a smileYes yes go and tell them to get it ready she answered returning his smileBoris quietly left the room and went in search of Natasha The plump boy ran after them angrily as if vexed that their program had been disturbed CHAPTER XII The only young people remaining in the drawing room not counting the young lady visitor and the countess eldest daughter who was four years older than her sister and behaved already like a grownup person were Nicholas and Sonya the niece Sonya was a slender little brunette with a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long lashes thick black plaits coiling twice round her head and a tawny tint in her complexion and especially in the color of her slender but graceful and muscular arms and neck By the grace of her movements by the softness and flexibility of her small limbs and by a certain coyness and reserve of manner she reminded one of a pretty halfgrown kitten which promises to become a beautiful little cat She evidently considered it proper to show an interest in the general conversation by smiling but in spite of herself her eyes under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who was going to join the army with such passionate girlish adoration that her smile could not for a single instant impose upon anyone and it was clear that the kitten had settled down only to spring up with more energy and again play with her cousin as soon as they too could like Natasha and Boris escape from the drawing roomAh yes my dear said the count addressing the visitor and pointing to Nicholas his friend Boris has become an officer and so for friendships sake he is leaving the university and me his old father and entering the military service my dear And there was a place and everything waiting for him in the Archives Department Isnt that friendship remarked the count in an inquiring toneBut they say that war has been declared replied the visitorTheyve been saying so a long while said the count and theyll say so again and again and that will be the end of it My dear theres friendship for you he repeated Hes joining the hussarsThe visitor not knowing what to say shook her headIts not at all from friendship declared Nicholas flaring up and turning away as if from a shameful aspersion It is not from friendship at all I simply feel that the army is my vocationHe glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor and they were both regarding him with a smile of approbationSchubert the colonel of the Pavlograd Hussars is dining with us today He has been here on leave and is taking Nicholas back with him It cant be helped said the count shrugging his shoulders and speaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed himI have already told you Papa said his son that if you dont wish to let me go Ill stay But I know I am no use anywhere except in the army I am not a diplomat or a government clerk  I dont know how to hide what I feel As he spoke he kept glancing with the flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at Sonya and the young lady visitorThe little kitten feasting her eyes on him seemed ready at any moment to start her gambols again and display her kittenish natureAll right all right said the old count He always flares up This Buonaparte has turned all their heads they all think of how he rose from an ensign and became Emperor Well well God grant it he added not noticing his visitors sarcastic smileThe elders began talking about Bonaparte Julie Karagina turned to young RostovWhat a pity you werent at the Arkharovs on Thursday It was so dull without you said she giving him a tender smileThe young man flattered sat down nearer to her with a coquettish smile and engaged the smiling Julie in a confidential conversation without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart of Sonya who blushed and smiled unnaturally In the midst of his talk he glanced round at her She gave him a passionately angry glance and hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile on her lips she got up and left the room All Nicholas animation vanished He waited for the first pause in the conversation and then with a distressed face left the room to find SonyaHow plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their sleeves said Anna Mikhaylovna pointing to Nicholas as he went out Cousinage  dangereux voisinage she added Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood Yes said the countess when the brightness these young people had brought into the room had vanished and as if answering a question no one had put but which was always in her mind and how much suffering how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in them now And yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy One is always always anxious Especially just at this age so dangerous both for girls and boysIt all depends on the bringing up remarked the visitorYes youre quite right continued the countess Till now I have always thank God been my childrens friend and had their full confidence said she repeating the mistake of so many parents who imagine that their children have no secrets from them I know I shall always be my daughters first confidante and that if Nicholas with his impulsive nature does get into mischief a boy cant help it he will all the same never be like those Petersburg young menYes they are splendid splendid youngsters chimed in the count who always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding that everything was splendid Just fancy wants to be an hussar Whats one to do my dearWhat a charming creature your younger girl is said the visitor a little volcanoYes a regular volcano said the count Takes after me And what a voice she has though shes my daughter I tell the truth when I say shell be a singer a second Salomoni We have engaged an Italian to give her lessonsIsnt she too young I have heard that it harms the voice to train it at that ageOh no not at all too young replied the count Why our mothers used to be married at twelve or thirteenAnd shes in love with Boris already Just fancy said the countess with a gentle smile looking at Boris and went on evidently concerned with a thought that always occupied her Now you see if I were to be severe with her and to forbid it goodness knows what they might be up to on the sly she meant that they would be kissing but as it is I know every word she utters She will come running to me of her own accord in the evening and tell me everything Perhaps I spoil her but really that seems the best plan With her elder sister I was stricterYes I was brought up quite differently remarked the handsome elder daughter Countess Vera with a smileBut the smile did not enhance Veras beauty as smiles generally do on the contrary it gave her an unnatural and therefore unpleasant expression Vera was goodlooking not at all stupid quick at learning was well brought up and had a pleasant voice what she said was true and appropriate yet strange to say everyone  the visitors and countess alike  turned to look at her as if wondering why she had said it and they all felt awkwardPeople are always too clever with their eldest children and try to make something exceptional of them said the visitorWhats the good of denying it my dear Our dear countess was too clever with Vera said the count Well what of that Shes turned out splendidly all the same he added winking at VeraThe guests got up and took their leave promising to return to dinnerWhat manners I thought they would never go said the countess when she had seen her guests out CHAPTER XIII When Natasha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the conservatory There she paused and stood listening to the conversation in the drawing room waiting for Boris to come out She was already growing impatient and stamped her foot ready to cry at his not coming at once when she heard the young mans discreet steps approaching neither quickly nor slowly At this Natasha dashed swiftly among the flower tubs and hid thereBoris paused in the middle of the room looked round brushed a little dust from the sleeve of his uniform and going up to a mirror examined his handsome face Natasha very still peered out from her ambush waiting to see what he would do He stood a little while before the glass smiled and walked toward the other door Natasha was about to call him but changed her mind Let him look for me thought she Hardly had Boris gone than Sonya flushed in tears and muttering angrily came in at the other door Natasha checked her first impulse to run out to her and remained in her hiding place watching  as under an invisible cap  to see what went on in the world She was experiencing a new and peculiar pleasure Sonya muttering to herself kept looking round toward the drawingroom door It opened and Nicholas came inSonya what is the matter with you How can you said he running up to herIts nothing nothing leave me alone sobbed SonyaAh I know what it isWell if you do so much the better and you can go back to herSooonya Look here How can you torture me and yourself like that for a mere fancy said Nicholas taking her handSonya did not pull it away and left off crying Natasha not stirring and scarcely breathing watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes What will happen now thought sheSonya What is anyone in the world to me You alone are everything said Nicholas And I will prove it to youI dont like you to talk like thatWell then I wont only forgive me Sonya He drew her to him and kissed herOh how nice thought Natasha and when Sonya and Nicholas had gone out of the conservatory she followed and called Boris to herBoris come here said she with a sly and significant look I have something to tell you Here here and she led him into the conservatory to the place among the tubs where she had been hidingBoris followed her smilingWhat is the something asked heShe grew confused glanced round and seeing the doll she had thrown down on one of the tubs picked it upKiss the doll said sheBoris looked attentively and kindly at her eager face but did not replyDont you want to Well then come here said she and went further in among the plants and threw down the doll Closer closer she whisperedShe caught the young officer by his cuffs and a look of solemnity and fear appeared on her flushed faceAnd me Would you like to kiss me she whispered almost inaudibly glancing up at him from under her brows smiling and almost crying from excitementBoris blushedHow funny you are he said bending down to her and blushing still more but he waited and did nothingSuddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he embraced him so that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck and tossing back her hair kissed him full on the lipsThen she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of the tubs and stood hanging her headNatasha he said you know that I love you butYou are in love with me Natasha broke inYes I am but please dont let us do like that In another four years then I will ask for your handNatasha consideredThirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen she counted on her slender little fingers All right Then its settledA smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager faceSettled replied BorisForever said the little girl Till death itselfShe took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining sitting room CHAPTER XIV After receiving her visitors the countess was so tired that she gave orders to admit no more but the porter was told to be sure to invite to dinner all who came to congratulate The countess wished to have a teteatete talk with the friend of her childhood Princess Anna Mikhaylovna whom she had not seen properly since she returned from Petersburg Anna Mikhaylovna with her tearworn but pleasant face drew her chair nearer to that of the countessWith you I will be quite frank said Anna Mikhaylovna There are not many left of us old friends Thats why I so value your friendshipAnna Mikhaylovna looked at Vera and paused The countess pressed her friends handVera she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a favorite how is it you have so little tact Dont you see you are not wanted here Go to the other girls orThe handsome Vera smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurtIf you had told me sooner Mamma I would have gone she replied as she rose to go to her own roomBut as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting one pair at each window She stopped and smiled scornfully Sonya was sitting close to Nicholas who was copying out some verses for her the first he had ever written Boris and Natasha were at the other window and ceased talking when Vera entered Sonya and Natasha looked at Vera with guilty happy facesIt was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love but apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in VeraHow often have I asked you not to take my things she said You have a room of your own and she took the inkstand from NicholasIn a minute in a minute he said dipping his penYou always manage to do things at the wrong time continued Vera You came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamed of youThough what she said was quite just perhaps for that very reason no one replied and the four simply looked at one another She lingered in the room with the inkstand in her handAnd at your age what secrets can there be between Natasha and Boris or between you two Its all nonsenseNow Vera what does it matter to you said Natasha in defense speaking very gentlyShe seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to everyoneVery silly said Vera I am ashamed of you Secrets indeedAll have secrets of their own answered Natasha getting warmer We dont interfere with you and BergI should think not said Vera because there can never be anything wrong in my behavior But Ill just tell Mamma how you are behaving with BorisNatalya Ilynichna behaves very well to me remarked Boris I have nothing to complain ofDont Boris You are such a diplomat that it is really tiresome said Natasha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly She used the word diplomat which was just then much in vogue among the children in the special sense they attached to it Why does she bother me And she added turning to Vera Youll never understand it because youve never loved anyone You have no heart You are a Madame de Genlis and nothing more this nickname bestowed on Vera by Nicholas was considered very stinging and your greatest pleasure is to be unpleasant to people Go and flirt with Berg as much as you please she finished quicklyI shall at any rate not run after a young man before visitorsWell now youve done what you wanted put in Nicholas  said unpleasant things to everyone and upset them Lets go to the nurseryAll four like a flock of scared birds got up and left the roomThe unpleasant things were said to me remarked Vera I said none to anyoneMadame de Genlis Madame de Genlis shouted laughing voices through the doorThe handsome Vera who produced such an irritating and unpleasant effect on everyone smiled and evidently unmoved by what had been said to her went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and scarf Looking at her own handsome face she seemed to become still colder and calmer In the drawing room the conversation was still going onAh my dear said the countess my life is not all roses either Dont I know that at the rate we are living our means wont last long Its all the Club and his easygoing nature Even in the country do we get any rest Theatricals hunting and heaven knows what besides But dont lets talk about me tell me how you managed everything I often wonder at you Annette  how at your age you can rush off alone in a carriage to Moscow to Petersburg to those ministers and great people and know how to deal with them all Its quite astonishing How did you get things settled I couldnt possibly do itAh my love answered Anna Mikhaylovna God grant you never know what it is to be left a widow without means and with a son you love to distraction One learns many things then she added with a certain pride That lawsuit taught me much When I want to see one of those big people I write a note Princess SoandSo desires an interview with So andSo and then I take a cab and go myself two three or four times  till I get what I want I dont mind what they think of meWell and to whom did you apply about Bory asked the countess You see yours is already an officer in the Guards while my Nicholas is going as a cadet Theres no one to interest himself for him To whom did you applyTo Prince Vasili He was so kind He at once agreed to everything and put the matter before the Emperor said Princess Anna Mikhaylovna enthusiastically quite forgetting all the humiliation she had endured to gain her endHas Prince Vasili aged much asked the countess I have not seen him since we acted together at the Rumyantsovs theatricals I expect he has forgotten me He paid me attentions in those days said the countess with a smileHe is just the same as ever replied Anna Mikhaylovna overflowing with amiability His position has not turned his head at all He said to me I am sorry I can do so little for you dear Princess I am at your command Yes he is a fine fellow and a very kind relation But Nataly you know my love for my son I would do anything for his happiness And my affairs are in such a bad way that my position is now a terrible one continued Anna Mikhaylovna sadly dropping her voice My wretched lawsuit takes all I have and makes no progress Would you believe it I have literally not a penny and dont know how to equip Boris She took out her handkerchief and began to cry I need five hundred rubles and have only one twentyfiveruble note I am in such a state My only hope now is in Count Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov If he will not assist his godson  you know he is Borys godfather  and allow him something for his maintenance all my trouble will have been thrown away I shall not be able to equip himThe countess eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silenceI often think though perhaps its a sin said the princess that here lives Count Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov so rich all alone that tremendous fortune and what is his life worth Its a burden to him and Borys life is only just beginningSurely he will leave something to Boris said the countessHeaven only knows my dear These rich grandees are so selfish Still I will take Boris and go to see him at once and I shall speak to him straight out Let people think what they will of me its really all the same to me when my sons fate is at stake The princess rose Its now two oclock and you dine at four There will just be timeAnd like a practical Petersburg lady who knows how to make the most of time Anna Mikhaylovna sent someone to call her son and went into the anteroom with himGoodby my dear said she to the countess who saw her to the door and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear Wish me good luckAre you going to Count Cyril Vladimirovich my dear said the count coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom and he added If he is better ask Pierre to dine with us He has been to the house you know and danced with the children Be sure to invite him my dear We will see how Taras distinguishes himself today He says Count Orlov never gave such a dinner as ours will be CHAPTER XV My dear Boris said Princess Anna Mikhaylovna to her son as Countess Rostovas carriage in which they were seated drove over the straw covered street and turned into the wide courtyard of Count Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhovs house My dear Boris said the mother drawing her hand from beneath her old mantle and laying it timidly and tenderly on her sons arm be affectionate and attentive to him Count Cyril Vladimirovich is your godfather after all your future depends on him Remember that my dear and be nice to him as you so well know how to beIf only I knew that anything besides humiliation would come of it answered her son coldly But I have promised and will do it for your sakeAlthough the hall porter saw someones carriage standing at the entrance after scrutinizing the mother and son who without asking to be announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the rows of statues in niches and looking significantly at the ladys old cloak he asked whether they wanted the count or the princesses and hearing that they wished to see the count said his excellency was worse today and that his excellency was not receiving anyoneWe may as well go back said the son in FrenchMy dear exclaimed his mother imploringly again laying her hand on his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse himBoris said no more but looked inquiringly at his mother without taking off his cloakMy friend said Anna Mikhaylovna in gentle tones addressing the hall porter I know Count Cyril Vladimirovich is very ill thats why I have come I am a relation I shall not disturb him my friend I only need see Prince Vasili Sergeevich he is staying here is he not Please announce meThe hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs and turned awayPrincess Drubetskaya to see Prince Vasili Sergeevich he called to a footman dressed in knee breeches shoes and a swallowtail coat who ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landingThe mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a large Venetian mirror in the wall and in her troddendown shoes briskly ascended the carpeted stairsMy dear she said to her son once more stimulating him by a touch you promised meThe son lowering his eyes followed her quietlyThey entered the large hall from which one of the doors led to the apartments assigned to Prince VasiliJust as the mother and son having reached the middle of the hall were about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as they entered the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and Prince Vasili came out  wearing a velvet coat with a single star on his breast as was his custom when at home  taking leave of a goodlooking darkhaired man This was the celebrated Petersburg doctor LorrainThen it is certain said the princePrince humanum est errare but replied the doctor swallowing his rs and pronouncing the Latin words with a French accent To err is human Very well very wellSeeing Anna Mikhaylovna and her son Prince Vasili dismissed the doctor with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of inquiry The son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow suddenly clouded his mothers face and he smiled slightlyAh Prince In what sad circumstances we meet again And how is our dear invalid said she as though unaware of the cold offensive look fixed on herPrince Vasili stared at her and at Boris questioningly and perplexed Boris bowed politely Prince Vasili without acknowledging the bow turned to Anna Mikhaylovna answering her query by a movement of the head and lips indicating very little hope for the patientIs it possible exclaimed Anna Mikhaylovna Oh how awful It is terrible to think This is my son she added indicating Boris He wanted to thank you himselfBoris bowed again politelyBelieve me Prince a mothers heart will never forget what you have done for usI am glad I was able to do you a service my dear Anna Mikhaylovna said Prince Vasili arranging his lace frill and in tone and manner here in Moscow to Anna Mikhaylovna whom he had placed under an obligation assuming an air of much greater importance than he had done in Petersburg at Anna Scherers receptionTry to serve well and show yourself worthy added he addressing Boris with severity I am glad Are you here on leave he went on in his usual tone of indifferenceI am awaiting orders to join my new regiment your excellency replied Boris betraying neither annoyance at the princes brusque manner nor a desire to enter into conversation but speaking so quietly and respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glanceAre you living with your motherI am living at Countess Rostovas replied Boris again adding your excellencyThat is with Ilya Rostov who married Nataly Shinshina said Anna MikhaylovnaI know I know answered Prince Vasili in his monotonous voice I never could understand how Nataly made up her mind to marry that unlicked bear A perfectly absurd and stupid fellow and a gambler too I am toldBut a very kind man Prince said Anna Mikhaylovna with a pathetic smile as though she too knew that Count Rostov deserved this censure but asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man What do the doctors say asked the princess after a pause her worn face again expressing deep sorrowThey give little hope replied the princeAnd I should so like to thank Uncle once for all his kindness to me and Boris He is his godson she added her tone suggesting that this fact ought to give Prince Vasili much satisfactionPrince Vasili became thoughtful and frowned Anna Mikhaylovna saw that he was afraid of finding in her a rival for Count Bezukhovs fortune and hastened to reassure himIf it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to Uncle said she uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern I know his character noble upright but you see he has no one with him except the young princesses They are still young She bent her head and continued in a whisper Has he performed his final duty Prince How priceless are those last moments It can make things no worse and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so ill We women Prince and she smiled tenderly always know how to say these things I absolutely must see him however painful it may be for me I am used to sufferingEvidently the prince understood her and also understood as he had done at Anna Pavlovnas that it would be difficult to get rid of Anna MikhaylovnaWould not such a meeting be too trying for him dear Anna Mikhaylovna said he Let us wait until evening The doctors are expecting a crisisBut one cannot delay Prince at such a moment Consider that the welfare of his soul is at stake Ah it is awful the duties of a ChristianA door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses the counts niece entered with a cold stern face The length of her body was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs Prince Vasili turned to herWell how is heStill the same but what can you expect this noise said the princess looking at Anna Mikhaylovna as at a strangerAh my dear I hardly knew you said Anna Mikhaylovna with a happy smile ambling lightly up to the counts niece I have come and am at your service to help you nurse my uncle I imagine what you have gone through and she sympathetically turned up her eyesThe princess gave no reply and did not even smile but left the room at Anna Mikhaylovna took off her gloves and occupying the position she had conquered settled down in an armchair inviting Prince Vasili to take a seat beside herBoris she said to her son with a smile I shall go in to see the count my uncle but you my dear had better go to Pierre meanwhile and dont forget to give him the Rostovs invitation They ask him to dinner I suppose he wont go she continued turning to the princeOn the contrary replied the prince who had plainly become depressed I shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young man Here he is and the count has not once asked for himHe shrugged his shoulders A footman conducted Boris down one flight of stairs and up another to Pierres rooms CHAPTER XVI Pierre after all had not managed to choose a career for himself in Petersburg and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and sent to Moscow The story told about him at Count Rostovs was true Pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear He had now been for some days in Moscow and was staying as usual at his fathers house Though he expected that the story of his escapade would be already known in Moscow and that the ladies about his father  who were never favorably disposed toward him  would have used it to turn the count against him he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to his fathers part of the house Entering the drawing room where the princesses spent most of their time he greeted the ladies two of whom were sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud It was the eldest who was reading  the one who had met Anna Mikhaylovna The two younger ones were embroidering both were rosy and pretty and they differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made her much prettier Pierre was received as if he were a corpse or a leper The eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared at him with frightened eyes the second assumed precisely the same expression while the youngest the one with the mole who was of a cheerful and lively disposition bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked by the amusing scene she foresaw She drew her wool down through the canvas and scarcely able to refrain from laughing stooped as if trying to make out the patternHow do you do cousin said Pierre You dont recognize meI recognize you only too well too wellHow is the count Can I see him asked Pierre awkwardly as usual but unabashedThe count is suffering physically and mentally and apparently you have done your best to increase his mental sufferingsCan I see the count Pierre again askedHm If you wish to kill him to kill him outright you can see him Olga go and see whether Uncles beef tea is ready  it is almost time she added giving Pierre to understand that they were busy and busy making his father comfortable while evidently he Pierre was only busy causing him annoyanceOlga went out Pierre stood looking at the sisters then he bowed and said Then I will go to my rooms You will let me know when I can see himAnd he left the room followed by the low but ringing laughter of the sister with the moleNext day Prince Vasili had arrived and settled in the counts house He sent for Pierre and said to him My dear fellow if you are going to behave here as you did in Petersburg you will end very badly that is all I have to say to you The count is very very ill and you must not see him at allSince then Pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in his rooms upstairsWhen Boris appeared at his door Pierre was pacing up and down his room stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall as if running a sword through an invisible foe and glaring savagely over his spectacles and then again resuming his walk muttering indistinct words shrugging his shoulders and gesticulatingEngland is done for said he scowling and pointing his finger at someone unseen Mr Pitt as a traitor to the nation and to the rights of man is sentenced to But before Pierre  who at that moment imagined himself to be Napoleon in person and to have just effected the dangerous crossing of the Straits of Dover and captured London  could pronounce Pitts sentence he saw a wellbuilt and handsome young officer entering his room Pierre paused He had left Moscow when Boris was a boy of fourteen and had quite forgotten him but in his usual impulsive and hearty way he took Boris by the hand with a friendly smileDo you remember me asked Boris quietly with a pleasant smile I have come with my mother to see the count but it seems he is not wellYes it seems he is ill People are always disturbing him answered Pierre trying to remember who this young man wasBoris felt that Pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it necessary to introduce himself and without experiencing the least embarrassment looked Pierre straight in the faceCount Rostov asks you to come to dinner today said he after a considerable pause which made Pierre feel uncomfortableAh Count Rostov exclaimed Pierre joyfully Then you are his son Ilya Only fancy I didnt know you at first Do you remember how we went to the Sparrow Hills with Madame Jacquot Its such an ageYou are mistaken said Boris deliberately with a bold and slightly sarcastic smile I am Boris son of Princess Anna Mikhaylovna Drubetskaya Rostov the father is Ilya and his son is Nicholas I never knew any Madame JacquotPierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or beesOh dear what am I thinking about Ive mixed everything up One has so many relatives in Moscow So you are Boris Of course Well now we know where we are And what do you think of the Boulogne expedition The English will come off badly you know if Napoleon gets across the Channel I think the expedition is quite feasible If only Villeneuve doesnt make a mess of thingsBoris knew nothing about the Boulogne expedition he did not read the papers and it was the first time he had heard Villeneuves nameWe here in Moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal than with politics said he in his quiet ironical tone I know nothing about it and have not thought about it Moscow is chiefly busy with gossip he continued Just now they are talking about you and your fatherPierre smiled in his goodnatured way as if afraid for his companions sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret But Boris spoke distinctly clearly and dryly looking straight into Pierres eyesMoscow has nothing else to do but gossip Boris went on Everybody is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune though he may perhaps outlive us all as I sincerely hope he willYes it is all very horrid interrupted Pierre very horridPierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say something disconcerting to himselfAnd it must seem to you said Boris flushing slightly but not changing his tone or attitude it must seem to you that everyone is trying to get something out of the rich manSo it does thought PierreBut I just wish to say to avoid misunderstandings that you are quite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people We are very poor but for my own part at any rate for the very reason that your father is rich I dont regard myself as a relation of his and neither I nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from himFor a long time Pierre could not understand but when he did he jumped up from the sofa seized Boris under the elbow in his quick clumsy way and blushing far more than Boris began to speak with a feeling of mingled shame and vexationWell this is strange Do you suppose I who could think I know very wellBut Boris again interrupted himI am glad I have spoken out fully Perhaps you did not like it You must excuse me said he putting Pierre at ease instead of being put at ease by him but I hope I have not offended you I always make it a rule to speak out Well what answer am I to take Will you come to dinner at the RostovsAnd Boris having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and extricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it became quite pleasant againNo but I say said Pierre calming down you are a wonderful fellow What you have just said is good very good Of course you dont know me We have not met for such a long time not since we were children You might think that I I understand quite understand I could not have done it myself I should not have had the courage but its splendid I am very glad to have made your acquaintance Its queer he added after a pause that you should have suspected me He began to laugh Well what of it I hope well get better acquainted and he pressed Boris hand Do you know I have not once been in to see the count He has not sent for me I am sorry for him as a man but what can one doAnd so you think Napoleon will manage to get an army across asked Boris with a smilePierre saw that Boris wished to change the subject and being of the same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the Boulogne expeditionA footman came in to summon Boris  the princess was going Pierre in order to make Boris better acquaintance promised to come to dinner and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles into Boris eyes After he had gone Pierre continued pacing up and down the room for a long time no longer piercing an imaginary foe with his imaginary sword but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasant intelligent and resolute young manAs often happens in early youth especially to one who leads a lonely life he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made up his mind that they would be friendsPrince Vasili saw the princess off She held a handkerchief to her eyes and her face was tearfulIt is dreadful dreadful she was saying but cost me what it may I shall do my duty I will come and spend the night He must not be left like this Every moment is precious I cant think why his nieces put it off Perhaps God will help me to find a way to prepare him Adieu Prince May God support youAdieu ma bonne answered Prince Vasili turning away from herOh he is in a dreadful state said the mother to her son when they were in the carriage He hardly recognizes anybodyI dont understand Mamma  what is his attitude to Pierre asked the sonThe will will show that my dear our fate also depends on itBut why do you expect that he will leave us anythingAh my dear He is so rich and we are so poorWell that is hardly a sufficient reason MammaOh Heaven How ill he is exclaimed the mother CHAPTER XVII After Anna Mikhaylovna had driven off with her son to visit Count Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov Countess Rostova sat for a long time all alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes At last she rangWhat is the matter with you my dear she said crossly to the maid who kept her waiting some minutes Dont you wish to serve me Then Ill find you another placeThe countess was upset by her friends sorrow and humiliating poverty and was therefore out of sorts a state of mind which with her always found expression in calling her maid my dear and speaking to her with exaggerated politenessI am very sorry maam answered the maidAsk the count to come to meThe count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty look as usualWell little countess What a saute of game au madere we are to have my dear I tasted it The thousand rubles I paid for Taras were not illspent He is worth itHe sat down by his wife his elbows on his knees and his hands ruffling his gray hairWhat are your commands little countessYou see my dear Whats that mess she said pointing to his waistcoat Its the saute most likely she added with a smile Well you see Count I want some moneyHer face became sadOh little countess and the count began bustling to get out his pocketbookI want a great deal Count I want five hundred rubles and taking out her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her husbands waistcoatYes immediately immediately Hey whos there he called out in a tone only used by persons who are certain that those they call will rush to obey the summons Send Dmitri to meDmitri a man of good family who had been brought up in the counts house and now managed all his affairs stepped softly into the roomThis is what I want my dear fellow said the count to the deferential young man who had entered Bring me he reflected a moment yes bring me seven hundred rubles yes But mind dont bring me such tattered and dirty notes as last time but nice clean ones for the countessYes Dmitri clean ones please said the countess sighing deeplyWhen would you like them your excellency asked Dmitri Allow me to inform you But dont be uneasy he added noticing that the count was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always a sign of approaching anger I was forgetting Do you wish it brought at onceYes yes just so Bring it Give it to the countessWhat a treasure that Dmitri is added the count with a smile when the young man had departed There is never any impossible with him Thats a thing I hate Everything is possibleAh money Count money How much sorrow it causes in the world said the countess But I am in great need of this sumYou my little countess are a notorious spendthrift said the count and having kissed his wifes hand he went back to his studyWhen Anna Mikhaylovna returned from Count Bezukhovs the money all in clean notes was lying ready under a handkerchief on the countess little table and Anna Mikhaylovna noticed that something was agitating herWell my dear asked the countessOh what a terrible state he is in One would not know him he is so ill I was only there a few moments and hardly said a wordAnnette for heavens sake dont refuse me the countess began with a blush that looked very strange on her thin dignified elderly face and she took the money from under the handkerchiefAnna Mikhaylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be ready to embrace the countess at the appropriate momentThis is for Boris from me for his outfitAnna Mikhaylovna was already embracing her and weeping The countess wept too They wept because they were friends and because they were kindhearted and because they  friends from childhood  had to think about such a base thing as money and because their youth was over But those tears were pleasant to them both CHAPTER XVIII Countess Rostova with her daughters and a large number of guests was already seated in the drawing room The count took the gentlemen into his study and showed them his choice collection of Turkish pipes From time to time he went out to ask Hasnt she come yet They were expecting Marya Dmitrievna Akhrosimova known in society as le terrible dragon a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank but for common sense and frank plainness of speech Marya Dmitrievna was known to the Imperial family as well as to all Moscow and Petersburg and both cities wondered at her laughed privately at her rudenesses and told good stories about her while none the less all without exception respected and feared herIn the counts room which was full of tobacco smoke they talked of war that had been announced in a manifesto and about the recruiting None of them had yet seen the manifesto but they all knew it had appeared The count sat on the sofa between two guests who were smoking and talking He neither smoked nor talked but bending his head first to one side and then to the other watched the smokers with evident pleasure and listened to the conversation of his two neighbors whom he egged on against each otherOne of them was a sallow cleanshaven civilian with a thin and wrinkled face already growing old though he was dressed like a most fashionable young man He sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth was inhaling the smoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes This was an old bachelor Shinshin a cousin of the countess a man with a sharp tongue as they said in Moscow society He seemed to be condescending to his companion The latter a fresh rosy officer of the Guards irreproachably washed brushed and buttoned held his pipe in the middle of his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled the smoke letting it escape from his handsome mouth in rings This was Lieutenant Berg an officer in the Semenov regiment with whom Boris was to travel to join the army and about whom Natasha had teased her elder sister Vera speaking of Berg as her intended The count sat between them and listened attentively His favorite occupation when not playing boston a card game he was very fond of was that of listener especially when he succeeded in setting two loquacious talkers at one anotherWell then old chap mon tres honorable Alphonse Karlovich said Shinshin laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary Russian expressions with the choicest French phrases  which was a peculiarity of his speech Vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur letat you want to make something out of your company You expect to make an income out of the government No Peter Nikolaevich I only want to show that in the cavalry the advantages are far less than in the infantry Just consider my own position now Peter NikolaevichBerg always spoke quietly politely and with great precision His conversation always related entirely to himself he would remain calm and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing on himself He could remain silent for hours without being at all put out of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable but as soon as the conversation concerned himself he would begin to talk circumstantially and with evident satisfactionConsider my position Peter Nikolaevich Were I in the cavalry I should get not more than two hundred rubles every four months even with the rank of lieutenant but as it is I receive two hundred and thirty said he looking at Shinshin and the count with a joyful pleasant smile as if it were obvious to him that his success must always be the chief desire of everyone elseBesides that Peter Nikolaevich by exchanging into the Guards I shall be in a more prominent position continued Berg and vacancies occur much more frequently in the Foot Guards Then just think what can be done with two hundred and thirty rubles I even manage to put a little aside and to send something to my father he went on emitting a smoke ringLa balance y est A German knows how to skin a flint as the proverb says remarked Shinshin moving his pipe to the other side of his mouth and winking at the count So that squares matters The count burst out laughing The other guests seeing that Shinshin was talking came up to listen Berg oblivious of irony or indifference continued to explain how by exchanging into the Guards he had already gained a step on his old comrades of the Cadet Corps how in wartime the company commander might get killed and he as senior in the company might easily succeed to the post how popular he was with everyone in the regiment and how satisfied his father was with him Berg evidently enjoyed narrating all this and did not seem to suspect that others too might have their own interests But all he said was so prettily sedate and the naivete of his youthful egotism was so obvious that he disarmed his hearersWell my boy youll get along wherever you go  foot or horse  that Ill warrant said Shinshin patting him on the shoulder and taking his feet off the sofaBerg smiled joyously The count by his guests went into the drawing room It was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guests expecting the summons to zakuska avoid engaging in any long conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk in order to show that they are not at all impatient for their food The host and hostess look toward the door and now and then glance at one another and the visitors try to guess from these glances who or what they are waiting for  some important relation who has not yet arrived or a dish that is not yet ready Hors doeuvres Pierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in the middle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come across blocking the way for everyone The countess tried to make him talk but he went on naively looking around through his spectacles as if in search of somebody and answered all her questions in monosyllables He was in the way and was the only one who did not notice the fact Most of the guests knowing of the affair with the bear looked with curiosity at this big stout quiet man wondering how such a clumsy modest fellow could have played such a prank on a policemanYou have only lately arrived the countess asked himOui madame replied he looking around himYou have not yet seen my husbandNon madame He smiled quite inappropriatelyYou have been in Paris recently I believe I suppose its very interestingVery interestingThe countess exchanged glances with Anna Mikhaylovna The latter understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man and sitting down beside him she began to speak about his father but he answered her as he had the countess only in monosyllables The other guests were all conversing with one another The Razumovskis It was charming You are very kind Countess Apraksina was heard on all sides The countess rose and went into the ballroomMarya Dmitrievna came her voice from thereHerself came the answer in a rough voice and Marya Dmitrievna entered the roomAll the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very oldest rose Marya Dmitrievna paused at the door Tall and stout holding high her fiftyyearold head with its gray curls she stood surveying the guests and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if rolling them up Marya Dmitrievna always spoke in RussianHealth and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to her children she said in her loud fulltoned voice which drowned all others Well you old sinner she went on turning to the count who was kissing her hand youre feeling dull in Moscow I daresay Nowhere to hunt with your dogs But what is to be done old man Just see how these nestlings are growing up and she pointed to the girls You must look for husbands for them whether you like it or notWell said she hows my Cossack Marya Dmitrievna always called Natasha a Cossack and she stroked the childs arm as she came up fearless and gay to kiss her hand I know shes a scamp of a girl but I like herShe took a pair of pearshaped ruby earrings from her huge reticule and having given them to the rosy Natasha who beamed with the pleasure of her saintsday fete turned away at once and addressed herself to PierreEh eh friend Come here a bit said she assuming a soft high tone of voice Come here my friend and she ominously tucked up her sleeves still higher Pierre approached looking at her in a childlike way through his spectaclesCome nearer come nearer friend I used to be the only one to tell your father the truth when he was in favor and in your case its my evident duty She paused All were silent expectant of what was to follow for this was dearly only a preludeA fine lad My word A fine lad His father lies on his deathbed and he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear For shame sir for shame It would be better if you went to the warShe turned away and gave her hand to the count who could hardly keep from laughingWell I suppose it is time we were at table said Marya DmitrievnaThe count went in first with Marya Dmitrievna the countess followed on the arm of a colonel of hussars a man of importance to them because Nicholas was to go with him to the regiment then came Anna Mikhaylovna with Shinshin Berg gave his arm to Vera The smiling Julie Karagina went in with Nicholas After them other couples followed filling the whole dining hall and last of all the children tutors and governesses followed singly The footmen began moving about chairs scraped the band struck up in the gallery and the guests settled down in their places Then the strains of the counts household band were replaced by the clatter of knives and forks the voices of visitors and the soft steps of the footmen At one end of the table sat the countess with Marya Dmitrievna on her right and Anna Mikhaylovna on her left the other lady visitors were farther down At the other end sat the count with the hussar colonel on his left and Shinshin and the other male visitors on his right Midway down the long table on one side sat the grownup young people Vera beside Berg and Pierre beside Boris and on the other side the children tutors and governesses From behind the crystal decanters and fruit vases the count kept glancing at his wife and her tall cap with its lightblue ribbons and busily filled his neighbors glasses not neglecting his own The countess in turn without omitting her duties as hostess threw significant glances from behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed by their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair At the ladies end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time at the mens end the voices sounded louder and louder especially that of the colonel of hussars who growing more and more flushed ate and drank so much that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests Berg with tender smiles was saying to Vera that love is not an earthly but a heavenly feeling Boris was telling his new friend Pierre who the guests were and exchanging glances with Natasha who was sitting opposite Pierre spoke little but examined the new faces and ate a great deal Of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and went on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines These latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward wrapped in a napkin from behind the next mans shoulders and whispered Dry Madeira Hungarian or Rhine wine as the case might be Of the four crystal glasses engraved with the counts monogram that stood before his plate Pierre held out one at random and drank with enjoyment gazing with everincreasing amiability at the other guests Natasha who sat opposite was looking at Boris as girls of thirteen look at the boy they are in love with and have just kissed for the first time Sometimes that same look fell on Pierre and that funny lively little girls look made him inclined to laugh without knowing whyNicholas sat at some distance from Sonya beside Julie Karagina to whom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile Sonya wore a company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy now she turned pale now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what Nicholas and Julie were saying to one another The governess kept looking round uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon the children The German tutor was trying to remember all the dishes wines and kinds of dessert in order to send a full description of the dinner to his people in Germany and he felt greatly offended when the butler with a bottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by He frowned trying to appear as if he did not want any of that wine but was mortified because no one would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or from greediness that he wanted it but simply from a conscientious desire for knowledge CHAPTER XIX At the mens end of the table the talk grew more and more animated The colonel told them that the declaration of war had already appeared in Petersburg and that a copy which he had himself seen had that day been forwarded by courier to the commander in chiefAnd why the deuce are we going to fight Bonaparte remarked Shinshin He has stopped Austrias cackle and I fear it will be our turn nextThe colonel was a stout tall plethoric German evidently devoted to the service and patriotically Russian He resented Shinshins remarkIt is for the reasson my goot sir said he speaking with a German accent for the reasson zat ze Emperor knows zat He declares in ze manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze danger vreatening Russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze Empire as vell as ze sanctity of its alliances he spoke this last word with particular emphasis as if in it lay the gist of the matterThen with the unerring official memory that characterized him he repeated from the opening words of the manifesto and the wish which constitutes the Emperors sole and absolute aim  to establish peace in Europe on firm foundations  has now decided him to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a new condition for the attainment of that purposeZat my dear sir is vy he concluded drinking a tumbler of wine with dignity and looking to the count for approvalConnaissezvous le Proverbe Jerome Jerome do not roam but turn spindles at home said Shinshin puckering his brows and smiling Cela nous convient a merveille Suvorov now  he knew what he was about yet they beat him a plate couture and where are we to find Suvorovs now Je vous demande un peu said he continually changing from French to Russian Do you know the proverb That suits us down to the ground Hollow I just ask you that Ve must vight to the last trrop of our plood said the colonel thumping the table and ve must tie for our Emperor and zen all vill pe vell And ve must discuss it as little as pooossible he dwelt particularly on the word possible as pooossible he ended again turning to the count Zat is how ve old hussars look at it and zeres an end of it And how do you a young man and a young hussar how do you judge of it he added addressing Nicholas who when he heard that the war was being discussed had turned from his partner with eyes and ears intent on the colonelI am quite of your opinion replied Nicholas flaming up turning his plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision and desperation as though he were at that moment facing some great danger I am convinced that we Russians must die or conquer he concluded conscious  as were others  after the words were uttered that his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and were therefore awkwardWhat you said just now was splendid said his partner JulieSonya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them and down to her neck and shoulders while Nicholas was speakingPierre listened to the colonels speech and nodded approvinglyThats fine said heThe young mans a real hussar shouted the colonel again thumping the tableWhat are you making such a noise about over there Marya Dmitrievnas deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of the table What are you thumping the table for she demanded of the hussar and why are you exciting yourself Do you think the French are hereI am speaking ze truce replied the hussar with a smileIts all about the war the count shouted down the table You know my sons going Marya Dmitrievna My son is goingI have four sons in the army but still I dont fret It is all in Gods hands You may die in your bed or God may spare you in a battle replied Marya Dmitrievnas deep voice which easily carried the whole length of the tableThats trueOnce more the conversations concentrated the ladies at the one end and the mens at the otherYou wont ask Natashas little brother was saying I know you wont askI will replied NatashaHer face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution She half rose by a glance inviting Pierre who sat opposite to listen to what was coming and turning to her motherMamma rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice audible the whole length of the tableWhat is it asked the countess startled but seeing by her daughters face that it was only mischief she shook a finger at her sternly with a threatening and forbidding movement of her headThe conversation was hushedMamma What sweets are we going to have and Natashas voice sounded still more firm and resoluteThe countess tried to frown but could not Marya Dmitrievna shook her fat fingerCossack she said threateninglyMost of the guests uncertain how to regard this sally looked at the eldersYou had better take care said the countessMamma What sweets are we going to have Natasha again cried boldly with saucy gaiety confident that her prank would be taken in good partSonya and fat little Petya doubled up with laughterYou see I have asked whispered Natasha to her little brother and to Pierre glancing at him againIce pudding but you wont get any said Marya DmitrievnaNatasha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even Marya DmitrievnaMarya Dmitrievna What kind of ice pudding I dont like ice creamCarrot icesNo What kind Marya Dmitrievna What kind she almost screamed I want to knowMarya Dmitrievna and the countess burst out laughing and all the guests joined in Everyone laughed not at Marya Dmitrievnas answer but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who had dared to treat Marya Dmitrievna in this fashionNatasha only desisted when she had been told that there would be pineapple ice Before the ices champagne was served round The band again struck up the count and countess kissed and the guests leaving their seats went up to congratulate the countess and reached across the table to clink glasses with the count with the children and with one another Again the footmen rushed about chairs scraped and in the same order in which they had entered but with redder faces the guests returned to the drawing room and to the counts study CHAPTER XX The card tables were drawn out sets made up for boston and the counts visitors settled themselves some in the two drawing rooms some in the sitting room some in the libraryThe count holding his cards fanwise kept himself with difficulty from dropping into his usual afterdinner nap and laughed at everything The young people at the countess instigation gathered round the clavichord and harp Julie by general request played first After she had played a little air with variations on the harp she joined the other young ladies in begging Natasha and Nicholas who were noted for their musical talent to sing something Natasha who was treated as though she were grown up was evidently very proud of this but at the same time felt shyWhat shall we sing she saidThe Brook suggested NicholasWell thenlets be quick Boris come here said Natasha But where is SonyaShe looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran to look for herRunning into Sonyas room and not finding her there Natasha ran to the nursery but Sonya was not there either Natasha concluded that she must be on the chest in the passage The chest in the passage was the place of mourning for the younger female generation in the Rostov household And there in fact was Sonya lying face downward on Nurses dirty feather bed on the top of the chest crumpling her gauzy pink dress under her hiding her face with her slender fingers and sobbing so convulsively that her bare little shoulders shook Natashas face which had been so radiantly happy all that saints day suddenly changed her eyes became fixed and then a shiver passed down her broad neck and the corners of her mouth droopedSonya What is it What is the matter Oo Oo Oo And Natashas large mouth widened making her look quite ugly and she began to wail like a baby without knowing why except that Sonya was crying Sonya tried to lift her head to answer but could not and hid her face still deeper in the bed Natasha wept sitting on the bluestriped feather bed and hugging her friend With an effort Sonya sat up and began wiping her eyes and explainingNicholas is going away in a weeks time his papers have come he told me himself but still I should not cry and she showed a paper she held in her hand  with the verses Nicholas had written still I should not cry but you cant no one can understand what a soul he hasAnd she began to cry again because he had such a noble soulIts all very well for you I am not envious I love you and Boris also she went on gaining a little strength he is nice there are no difficulties in your way But Nicholas is my cousin one would have to the Metropolitan himself and even then it cant be done And besides if she tells Mamma Sonya looked upon the countess as her mother and called her so that I am spoiling Nicholas career and am heartless and ungrateful while truly God is my witness and she made the sign of the cross I love her so much and all of you only Vera And what for What have I done to her I am so grateful to you that I would willingly sacrifice everything only I have nothingSonya could not continue and again hid her face in her hands and in the feather bed Natasha began consoling her but her face showed that she understood all the gravity of her friends troubleSonya she suddenly exclaimed as if she had guessed the true reason of her friends sorrow Im sure Vera has said something to you since dinner Hasnt sheYes these verses Nicholas wrote himself and I copied some others and she found them on my table and said shed show them to Mamma and that I was ungrateful and that Mamma would never allow him to marry me but that hell marry Julie You see how hes been with her all day Natasha what have I done to deserve itAnd again she began to sob more bitterly than before Natasha lifted her up hugged her and smiling through her tears began comforting herSonya dont believe her darling Dont believe her Do you remember how we and Nicholas all three of us talked in the sitting room after supper Why we settled how everything was to be I dont quite remember how but dont you remember that it could all be arranged and how nice it all was Theres Uncle Shinshins brother has married his first cousin And we are only second cousins you know And Boris says it is quite possible You know I have told him all about it And he is so clever and so good said Natasha Dont you cry Sonya dear love darling Sonya and she kissed her and laughed Veras spiteful never mind her And all will come right and she wont say anything to Mamma Nicholas will tell her himself and he doesnt care at all for JulieNatasha kissed her on the hairSonya sat up The little kitten brightened its eyes shone and it seemed ready to lift its tail jump down on its soft paws and begin playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten shouldDo you think so Really Truly she said quickly smoothing her frock and hairReally truly answered Natasha pushing in a crisp lock that had strayed from under her friends plaitsBoth laughedWell lets go and sing The BrookCome alongDo you know that fat Pierre who sat opposite me is so funny said Natasha stopping suddenly I feel so happyAnd she set off at a run along the passageSonya shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest ran after Natasha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face and light joyous steps At the visitors request the young people sang the quartette The Brook with which everyone was delighted Then Nicholas sang a song he had just learned At nighttime in the moons fair glow How sweet as fancies wander free To feel that in this world theres one Who still is thinking but of thee That while her fingers touch the harp Wafting sweet music music the lea It is for thee thus swells her heart Sighing its message out to thee A day or two then bliss unspoilt But oh till then I cannot live He had not finished the last verse before the young people began to get ready to dance in the large hall and the sound of the feet and the coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery Pierre was sitting in the drawingroom where Shinshin had engaged him as a man recently returned from abroad in a political conversation in which several others joined but which bored Pierre When the music began Natasha came in and walking straight up to Pierre said laughing and blushingMamma told me to ask you to join the dancersI am afraid of mixing the figures Pierre replied but if you will be my teacher And lowering his big arm he offered it to the slender little girlWhile the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up Pierre sat down with his little partner Natasha was perfectly happy she was dancing with a grownup man who had been abroad She was sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a grownup lady She had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had given her to hold Assuming quite the pose of a society woman heaven knows when and where she had learned it she talked with her partner fanning herself and smiling over the fanDear dear Just look at her exclaimed the countess as she crossed the ballroom pointing to NatashaNatasha blushed and laughedWell really Mamma Why should you What is there to be surprised at In the midst of the third ecossaise there was a clatter of chairs being pushed back in the sitting room where the count and Marya Dmitrievna had been playing cards with the majority of the more distinguished and older visitors They now stretching themselves after sitting so long and replacing their purses and pocketbooks entered the ballroom First came Marya Dmitrievna and the count both with merry countenances The count with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style offered his bent arm to Marya Dmitrievna He drew himself up a smile of debonair gallantry lit up his face and as soon as the last figure of the ecossaise was ended he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery addressing the first violinSemen Do you know the Daniel CooperThis was the counts favorite dance which he had danced in his youth Strictly speaking Daniel Cooper was one figure of the anglaiseLook at Papa shouted Natasha to the whole company and quite forgetting that she was dancing with a grownup partner she bent her curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughterAnd indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the jovial old gentleman who standing beside his tall and stout partner Marya Dmitrievna curved his arms beat time straightened his shoulders turned out his toes tapped gently with his foot and by a smile that broadened his round face more and more prepared the onlookers for what was to follow As soon as the provocatively gay strains of Daniel Cooper somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant dance began to sound all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly filled by the domestic serfs  the men on one side and the women on the other  who with beaming faces had come to see their master making merryJust look at the master A regular eagle he is loudly remarked the nurse as she stood in one of the doorwaysThe count danced well and knew it But his partner could not and did not want to dance well Her enormous figure stood erect her powerful arms hanging down she had handed her reticule to the countess and only her stern but handsome face really joined in the dance What was expressed by the whole of the counts plump figure in Marya Dmitrievna found expression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose But if the count getting more and more into the swing of it charmed the spectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and the agility with which he capered about on his light feet Marya Dmitrievna produced no less impression by slight exertions  the least effort to move her shoulders or bend her arms when turning or stamp her foot  which everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual severity The dance grew livelier and livelier The other couples could not attract a moments attention to their own evolutions and did not even try to do so All were watching the count and Marya Dmitrievna Natasha kept pulling everyone by sleeve or dress urging them to look at Papa though as it was they never took their eyes off the couple In the intervals of the dance the count breathing deeply waved and shouted to the musicians to play faster Faster faster and faster lightly more lightly and yet more lightly whirled the count flying round Marya Dmitrievna now on his toes now on his heels until turning his partner round to her seat he executed the final pas raising his soft foot backwards bowing his perspiring head smiling and making a wide sweep with his arm amid a thunder of applause and laughter led by Natasha Both partners stood still breathing heavily and wiping their faces with their cambric handkerchiefsThats how we used to dance in our time ma chere said the countThat was a Daniel Cooper exclaimed Marya Dmitrievna tucking up her sleeves and puffing heavily CHAPTER XXI While in the Rostovs ballroom the sixth anglaise was being danced to a tune in which the weary musicians blundered and while tired footmen and cooks were getting the supper Count Bezukhov had a sixth stroke The doctors pronounced recovery impossible After a mute confession communion was administered to the dying man preparations made for the sacrament of unction and in his house there was the bustle and thrill of suspense usual at such moments Outside the house beyond the gates a group of undertakers who hid whenever a carriage drove up waited in expectation of an important order for an expensive funeral The Military Governor of Moscow who had been assiduous in sending aidesdecamp to inquire after the counts health came himself that evening to bid a last farewell to the celebrated grandee of Catherines court Count BezukhovThe magnificent reception room was crowded Everyone stood up respectfully when the Military Governor having stayed about half an hour alone with the dying man passed out slightly acknowledging their bows and trying to escape as quickly as from the glances fixed on him by the doctors clergy and relatives of the family Prince Vasili who had grown thinner and paler during the last few days escorted him to the door repeating something to him several times in low tonesWhen the Military Governor had gone Prince Vasili sat down all alone on a chair in the ballroom crossing one leg high over the other leaning his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand After sitting so for a while he rose and looking about him with frightened eyes went with unusually hurried steps down the long corridor leading to the back of the house to the room of the eldest princessThose who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous whispers and whenever anyone went into or came from the dying mans room grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or expectancy at his door which creaked slightly when openedThe limits of human life are fixed and may not be oerpassed said an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat beside him and was listening naively to his wordsI wonder is it not too late to administer unction asked the lady adding the priests clerical title as if she had no opinion of her own on the subjectAh madam it is a great sacrament replied the priest passing his hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his bald headWho was that The Military Governor himself was being asked at the other side of the room How younglooking he isYes and he is over sixty I hear the count no longer recognizes anyone They wished to administer the sacrament of unctionI knew someone who received that sacrament seven timesThe second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red from weeping and sat down beside Dr Lorrain who was sitting in a graceful pose under a portrait of Catherine leaning his elbow on a tableBeautiful said the doctor in answer to a remark about the weather The weather is beautiful Princess and besides in Moscow one feels as if one were in the countryYes indeed replied the princess with a sigh So he may have something to drinkLorrain consideredHas he taken his medicineYesThe doctor glanced at his watchTake a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar and he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinchDere has neffer been a gase a German doctor was saying to an aidedecamp dat one liffs after de sird strokeAnd what a wellpreserved man he was remarked the aidedecamp And who will inherit his wealth he added in a whisperIt vont go begging replied the German with a smileEveryone again looked toward the door which creaked as the second princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to Lorrains instructions The German doctor went up to LorrainDo you think he can last till morning asked the German addressing Lorrain in French which he pronounced badlyLorrain pursing up his lips waved a severely negative finger before his noseTonight not later said he in a low voice and he moved away with a decorous smile of selfsatisfaction at being able clearly to understand and state the patients condition Meanwhile Prince Vasili had opened the door into the princess roomIn this room it was almost dark only two tiny lamps were burning before the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles The room was crowded with small pieces of furniture whatnots cupboards and little tables The quilt of a high white feather bed was just visible behind a screen A small dog began to barkAh is it you cousinShe rose and smoothed her hair which was as usual so extremely smooth that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered with varnishHas anything happened she asked I am so terrifiedNo there is no change I only came to have a talk about business Catiche muttered the prince seating himself wearily on the chair she had just vacated You have made the place warm I must say he remarked Well sit down lets have a talk Catherine I thought perhaps something had happened she said with her unchanging stonily severe expression and sitting down opposite the prince she prepared to listenI wished to get a nap mon cousin but I cantWell my dear said Prince Vasili taking her hand and bending it downwards as was his habitIt was plain that this well referred to much that they both understood without namingThe princess who had a straight rigid body abnormally long for her legs looked directly at Prince Vasili with no sign of emotion in her prominent gray eyes Then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons with a sigh This might have been taken as an expression of sorrow and devotion or of weariness and hope of resting before long Prince Vasili understood it as an expression of wearinessAnd I he said do you think it is easier for me I am as worn out as a post horse but still I must have a talk with you Catiche a very serious talkPrince Vasili said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously now on one side now on the other giving his face an unpleasant expression which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room His eyes too seemed strange at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the next glanced round in alarmThe princess holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony hands looked attentively into Prince Vasilis eyes evidently resolved not to be the first to break silence if she had to wait till morningWell you see my dear princess and cousin Catherine Semenovna continued Prince Vasili returning to his theme apparently not without an inner struggle at such a moment as this one must think of everything One must think of the future of all of you I love you all like children of my own as you knowThe princess continued to look at him without moving and with the same dull expressionAnd then of course my family has also to be considered Prince Vasili went on testily pushing away a little table without looking at her You know Catiche that we  you three sisters Mamontov and my wife  are the counts only direct heirs I know I know how hard it is for you to talk or think of such matters It is no easier for me but my dear I am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for anything Do you know I have sent for Pierre The count pointing to his portrait definitely demanded that he should be calledPrince Vasili looked questioningly at the princess but could not make out whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was simply looking at himThere is one thing I constantly pray God to grant mon cousin she replied and it is that He would be merciful to him and would allow his noble soul peacefully to leave thisYes yes of course interrupted Prince Vasili impatiently rubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little table that he had pushed away But in short the fact is you know yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he left all his property not to us his direct heirs but to PierreHe has made wills enough quietly remarked the princess But he cannot leave the estate to Pierre Pierre is illegitimateBut my dear said Prince Vasili suddenly clutching the little table and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly what if a letter has been written to the Emperor in which the count asks for Pierres legitimation Do you understand that in consideration of the counts services his request would be grantedThe princess smiled as people do who think they know more about the subject under discussion than those they are talking withI can tell you more continued Prince Vasili seizing her hand that letter was written though it was not sent and the Emperor knew of it The only question is has it been destroyed or not If not then as soon as all is over and Prince Vasili sighed to intimate what he meant by the words all is over and the counts papers are opened the will and letter will be delivered to the Emperor and the petition will certainly be granted Pierre will get everything as the legitimate sonAnd our share asked the princess smiling ironically as if anything might happen only not thatBut my poor Catiche it is as clear as daylight He will then be the legal heir to everything and you wont get anything You must know my dear whether the will and letter were written and whether they have been destroyed or not And if they have somehow been overlooked you ought to know where they are and must find them becauseWhat next the princess interrupted smiling sardonically and not changing the expression of her eyes I am a woman and you think we are all stupid but I know this an illegitimate son cannot inherit un batard she added as if supposing that this translation of the word would effectively prove to Prince Vasili the invalidity of his contention A bastard Well really Catiche Cant you understand You are so intelligent how is it you dont see that if the count has written a letter to the Emperor begging him to recognize Pierre as legitimate it follows that Pierre will not be Pierre but will become Count Bezukhov and will then inherit everything under the will And if the will and letter are not destroyed then you will have nothing but the consolation of having been dutiful et tout ce qui sensuit Thats certain And all that follows therefrom I know the will was made but I also know that it is invalid and you mon cousin seem to consider me a perfect fool said the princess with the expression women assume when they suppose they are saying something witty and stingingMy dear Princess Catherine Semenovna began Prince Vasili impatiently I came here not to wrangle with you but to talk about your interests as with a kinswoman a good kind true relation And I tell you for the tenth time that if the letter to the Emperor and the will in Pierres favor are among the counts papers then my dear girl you and your sisters are not heiresses If you dont believe me then believe an expert I have just been talking to Dmitri Onufrich the family solicitor and he says the sameAt this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess ideas her thin lips grew white though her eyes did not change and her voice when she began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself evidently did not expectThat would be a fine thing said she I never wanted anything and I dont nowShe pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dressAnd this is gratitude  this is recognition for those who have sacrificed everything for his sake she cried Its splendid Fine I dont want anything PrinceYes but you are not the only one There are your sisters replied Prince VasiliBut the princess did not listen to himYes I knew it long ago but had forgotten I knew that I could expect nothing but meanness deceit envy intrigue and ingratitude  the blackest ingratitude  in this houseDo you or do you not know where that will is insisted Prince Vasili his cheeks twitching more than everYes I was a fool I still believed in people loved them and sacrificed myself But only the base the vile succeed I know who has been intriguingThe princees wished to rise but the prince held her by the hand She had the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human race She gave her companion an angry glanceThere is still time my dear You must remember Catiche that it was all done casually in a moment of anger of illness and was afterwards forgotten Our duty my dear is to rectify his mistake to ease his last moments by not letting him commit this injustice and not to let him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those whoWho sacrificed everything for him chimed in the princess who would again have risen had not the prince still held her fast though he never could appreciate it No mon cousin she added with a sigh I shall always remember that in this world one must expect no reward that in this world there is neither honor nor justice In this world one has to be cunning and cruelNow come come Be reasonable I know your excellent heartNo I have a wicked heartI know your heart repeated the prince I value your friendship and wish you to have as good an opinion of me Dont upset yourself and let us talk sensibly while there is still time be it a day or be it but an hour Tell me all you know about the will and above all where it is You must know We will take it at once and show it to the count He has no doubt forgotten it and will wish to destroy it You understand that my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his wishes that is my only reason for being here I came simply to help him and youNow I see it all I know who has been intriguing  I know cried the princessThats not the point my dearIts that protege of yours that sweet Princess Drubetskaya that Anna Mikhaylovna whom I would not take for a housemaid the infamous vile womanDo not let us lose any timeAh dont talk to me Last winter she wheedled herself in here and told the count such vile disgraceful things about us especially about Sophie  I cant repeat them  that it made the count quite ill and he would not see us for a whole fortnight I know it was then he wrote this vile infamous paper but I thought the thing was invalidWeve got to it at last  why did you not tell me about it soonerIts in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under his pillow said the princess ignoring his question Now I know Yes if I have a sin a great sin it is hatred of that vile woman almost shrieked the princess now quite changed And what does she come worming herself in here for But I will give her a piece of my mind The time will come CHAPTER XXII While these conversations were going on in the reception room and the princess room a carriage containing Pierre who had been sent for and Anna Mikhaylovna who found it necessary to accompany him was driving into the court of Count Bezukhovs house As the wheels rolled softly over the straw beneath the windows Anna Mikhaylovna having turned with words of comfort to her companion realized that he was asleep in his corner and woke him up Rousing himself Pierre followed Anna Mikhaylovna out of the carriage and only then began to think of the interview with his dying father which awaited him He noticed that they had not come to the front entrance but to the back door While he was getting down from the carriage steps two men who looked like tradespeople ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the shadow of the wall Pausing for a moment Pierre noticed several other men of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides But neither Anna Mikhaylovna nor the footman nor the coachman who could not help seeing these people took any notice of them It seems to be all right Pierre concluded and followed Anna Mikhaylovna She hurriedly ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase calling to Pierre who was lagging behind to follow Though he did not see why it was necessary for him to go to the count at all still less why he had to go by the back stairs yet judging by Anna Mikhaylovnas air of assurance and haste Pierre concluded that it was all absolutely necessary Halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over by some men who carrying pails came running downstairs their boots clattering These men pressed close to the wall to let Pierre and Anna Mikhaylovna pass and did not evince the least surprise at seeing them thereIs this the way to the princesses apartments asked Anna Mikhaylovna of one of themYes replied a footman in a bold loud voice as if anything were now permissible the door to the left maamPerhaps the count did not ask for me said Pierre when he reached the landing Id better go to my own roomAnna Mikhaylovna paused and waited for him to come upAh my friend she said touching his arm as she had done her sons when speaking to him that afternoon believe me I suffer no less than you do but be a manBut really hadnt I better go away he asked looking kindly at her over his spectaclesAh my dear friend Forget the wrongs that may have been done you Think that he is your father perhaps in the agony of death She sighed I have loved you like a son from the first Trust yourself to me Pierre I shall not forget your interestsPierre did not understand a word but the conviction that all this had to be grew stronger and he meekly followed Anna Mikhaylovna who was already opening a doorThis door led into a back anteroom An old man a servant of the princesses sat in a corner knitting a stocking Pierre had never been in this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of these rooms Anna Mikhaylovna addressing a maid who was hurrying past with a decanter on a tray as my dear and my sweet asked about the princess health and then led Pierre along a stone passage The first door on the left led into the princesses apartments The maid with the decanter in her haste had not closed the door everything in the house was done in haste at that time and Pierre and Anna Mikhaylovna in passing instinctively glanced into the room where Prince Vasili and the eldest princess were sitting close together talking Seeing them pass Prince Vasili drew back with obvious impatience while the princess jumped up and with a gesture of desperation slammed the door with all her mightThis action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted on Prince Vasilis face so out of keeping with his dignity that Pierre stopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide Anna Mikhaylovna evinced no surprise she only smiled faintly and sighed as if to say that this was no more than she had expectedBe a man my friend I will look after your interests said she in reply to his look and went still faster along the passagePierre could not make out what it was all about and still less what watching over his interests meant but he decided that all these things had to be From the passage they went into a large dimly lit room adjoining the counts reception room It was one of those sumptuous but cold apartments known to Pierre only from the front approach but even in this room there now stood an empty bath and water had been spilled on the carpet They were met by a deacon with a censer and by a servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them They went into the reception room familiar to Pierre with two Italian windows opening into the conservatory with its large bust and full length portrait of Catherine the Great The same people were still sitting here in almost the same positions as before whispering to one another All became silent and turned to look at the pale tearworn Anna Mikhaylovna as she entered and at the big stout figure of Pierre who hanging his head meekly followed herAnna Mikhaylovnas face expressed a consciousness that the decisive moment had arrived With the air of a practical Petersburg lady she now keeping Pierre close beside her entered the room even more boldly than that afternoon She felt that as she brought with her the person the dying man wished to see her own admission was assured Casting a rapid glance at all those in the room and noticing the counts confessor there she glided up to him with a sort of amble not exactly bowing yet seeming to grow suddenly smaller and respectfully received the blessing first of one and then of another priestGod be thanked that you are in time said she to one of the priests all we relatives have been in such anxiety This young man is the counts son she added more softly What a terrible momentHaving said this she went up to the doctorDear doctor said she this young man is the counts son Is there any hopeThe doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his shoulders Anna Mikhaylovna with just the same movement raised her shoulders and eyes almost closing the latter sighed and moved away from the doctor to Pierre To him in a particularly respectful and tenderly sad voice she saidTrust in His mercy and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit and wait for her she went silently toward the door that everyone was watching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind itPierre having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly moved toward the sofa she had indicated As soon as Anna Mikhaylovna had disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to him with something more than curiosity and sympathy He noticed that they whispered to one another casting significant looks at him with a kind of awe and even servility A deference such as he had never before received was shown him A strange lady the one who had been talking to the priests rose and offered him her seat an aidedecamp picked up and returned a glove Pierre had dropped the doctors became respectfully silent as he passed by and moved to make way for him At first Pierre wished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady and also to pick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were not even in his way but all at once he felt that this would not do and that tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful rite which everyone expected of him and that he was therefore bound to accept their services He took the glove in silence from the aidedecamp and sat down in the ladys chair placing his huge hands symmetrically on his knees in the naive attitude of an Egyptian statue and decided in his own mind that all was as it should be and that in order not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on his own ideas tonight but must yield himself up entirely to the will of those who were guiding himNot two minutes had passed before Prince Vasili with head erect majestically entered the room He was wearing his long coat with three stars on his breast He seemed to have grown thinner since the morning his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed Pierre He went up to him took his hand a thing he never used to do and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmly fixed onCourage courage my friend He has asked to see you That is well and he turned to goBut Pierre thought it necessary to ask How is and hesitated not knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man the count yet ashamed to call him fatherHe had another stroke about half an hour ago Courage my friendPierres mind was in such a confused state that the word stroke suggested to him a blow from something He looked at Prince Vasili in perplexity and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of illness Prince Vasili said something to Lorrain in passing and went through the door on tiptoe He could not walk well on tiptoe and his whole body jerked at each step The eldest princess followed him and the priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the door Through that door was heard a noise of things being moved about and at last Anna Mikhaylovna still with the same expression pale but resolute in the discharge of duty ran out and touching Pierre lightly on the arm saidThe divine mercy is inexhaustible Unction is about to be administered ComePierre went in at the door stepping on the soft carpet and noticed that the strange lady the aidedecamp and some of the servants all followed him in as if there were now no further need for permission to enter that room CHAPTER XXIII Pierre well knew this large room divided by columns and an arch its walls hung round with Persian carpets The part of the room behind the columns with a high silkcurtained mahogany bedstead on one side and on the other an immense case containing icons was brightly illuminated with red light like a Russian church during evening service Under the gleaming icons stood a long invalid chair and in that chair on snowywhite smooth pillows evidently freshly changed Pierre saw  covered to the waist by a bright green quilt  the familiar majestic figure of his father Count Bezukhov with that gray mane of hair above his broad forehead which reminded one of a lion and the deep characteristically noble wrinkles of his handsome ruddy face He lay just under the icons his large thick hands outside the quilt Into the right hand which was lying palm downwards a wax taper had been thrust between forefinger and thumb and an old servant bending over from behind the chair held it in position By the chair stood the priests their long hair falling over their magnificent glittering vestments with lighted tapers in their hands slowly and solemnly conducting the service A little behind them stood the two younger princesses holding handkerchiefs to their eyes and just in front of them their eldest sister Catiche with a vicious and determined look steadily fixed on the icons as though declaring to all that she could not answer for herself should she glance round Anna Mikhaylovna with a meek sorrowful and allforgiving expression on her face stood by the door near the strange lady Prince Vasili in front of the door near the invalid chair a wax taper in his left hand was leaning his left arm on the carved back of a velvet chair he had turned round for the purpose and was crossing himself with his right hand turning his eyes upward each time he touched his forehead His face wore a calm look of piety and resignation to the will of God If you do not understand these sentiments he seemed to be saying so much the worse for youBehind him stood the aidedecamp the doctors and the menservants the men and women had separated as in church All were silently crossing themselves and the reading of the church service the subdued chanting of deep bass voices and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling of feet were the only sounds that could be heard Anna Mikhaylovna with an air of importance that showed that she felt she quite knew what she was about went across the room to where Pierre was standing and gave him a taper He lit it and distracted by observing those around him began crossing himself with the hand that held the taperSophie the rosy laughterloving youngest princess with the mole watched him She smiled hid her face in her handkerchief and remained with it hidden for awhile then looking up and seeing Pierre she again began to laugh She evidently felt unable to look at him without laughing but could not resist looking at him so to be out of temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns In the midst of the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased they whispered to one another and the old servant who was holding the counts hand got up and said something to the ladies Anna Mikhaylovna stepped forward and stooping over the dying man beckoned to Lorrain from behind her back The French doctor held no taper he was leaning against one of the columns in a respectful attitude implying that he a foreigner in spite of all differences of faith understood the full importance of the rite now being performed and even approved of it He now approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full vigor of life with his delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the hand that was free and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected a moment The sick man was given something to drink there was a stir around him then the people resumed their places and the service continued During this interval Pierre noticed that Prince Vasili left the chair on which he had been leaning and  with air which intimated that he knew what he was about and if others did not understand him it was so much the worse for them  did not go up to the dying man but passed by him joined the eldest princess and moved with her to the side of the room where stood the high bedstead with its silken hangings On leaving the bed both Prince Vasili and the princess passed out by a back door but returned to their places one after the other before the service was concluded Pierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to the rest of what went on having made up his mind once for all that what he saw happening around him that evening was in some way essentialThe chanting of the service ceased and the voice of the priest was heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the sacrament The dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before Around him everyone began to stir steps were audible and whispers among which Anna Mikhaylovnas was the most distinctPierre heard her sayCertainly he must be moved onto the bed here it will be impossibleThe sick man was so surrounded by doctors princesses and servants that Pierre could no longer see the reddishyellow face with its gray mane  which though he saw other faces as well he had not lost sight of for a single moment during the whole service He judged by the cautious movements of those who crowded round the invalid chair that they had lifted the dying man and were moving himCatch hold of my arm or youll drop him he heard one of the servants say in a frightened whisper Catch hold from underneath Here exclaimed different voices and the heavy breathing of the bearers and the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried as if the weight they were carrying were too much for themAs the bearers among whom was Anna Mikhaylovna passed the young man he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dying mans high stout uncovered chest and powerful shoulders raised by those who were holding him under the armpits and of his gray curly leonine head This head with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones its handsome sensual mouth and its cold majestic expression was not disfigured by the approach of death It was the same as Pierre remembered it three months before when the count had sent him to Petersburg But now this head was swaying helplessly with the uneven movements of the bearers and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon nothingAfter a few minutes bustle beside the high bedstead those who had carried the sick man dispersed Anna Mikhaylovna touched Pierres hand and said Come Pierre went with her to the bed on which the sick man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony just completed He lay with his head propped high on the pillows His hands were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt the palms downward When Pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him but with a look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal man Either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes they must look somewhere or it meant too much Pierre hesitated not knowing what to do and glanced inquiringly at his guide Anna Mikhaylovna made a hurried sign with her eyes glancing at the sick mans hand and moving her lips as if to send it a kiss Pierre carefully stretching his neck so as not to touch the quilt followed her suggestion and pressed his lips to the large boned fleshy hand Neither the hand nor a single muscle of the counts face stirred Once more Pierre looked questioningly at Anna Mikhaylovna to see what he was to do next Anna Mikhaylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood beside the bed Pierre obediently sat down his eyes asking if he were doing right Anna Mikhaylovna nodded approvingly Again Pierre fell into the naively symmetrical pose of an Egyptian statue evidently distressed that his stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing his utmost to look as small as possible He looked at the count who still gazed at the spot where Pierres face had been before he sat down Anna Mikhaylovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness of the pathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between the father and son This lasted about two minutes which to Pierre seemed an hour Suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the counts face began to twitch The twitching increased the handsome mouth was drawn to one side only now did Pierre realize how near death his father was and from that distorted mouth issued an indistinct hoarse sound Anna Mikhaylovna looked attentively at the sick mans eyes trying to guess what he wanted she pointed first to Pierre then to some drink then named Prince Vasili in an inquiring whisper then pointed to the quilt The eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience He made an effort to look at the servant who stood constantly at the head of the bedWants to turn on the other side whispered the servant and got up to turn the counts heavy body toward the wallPierre rose to help himWhile the count was being turned over one of his arms fell back helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward Whether he noticed the look of terror with which Pierre regarded that lifeless arm or whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain at any rate he glanced at the refractory arm at Pierres terrorstricken face and again at the arm and on his face a feeble piteous smile appeared quite out of keeping with his features that seemed to deride his own helplessness At sight of this smile Pierre felt an unexpected quivering in his breast and a tickling in his nose and tears dimmed his eyes The sick man was turned on to his side with his face to the wall He sighedHe is dozing said Anna Mikhaylovna observing that one of the princesses was coming to take her turn at watching Let us goPierre went out CHAPTER XXIV There was now no one in the reception room except Prince Vasili and the eldest princess who were sitting under the portrait of Catherine the Great and talking eagerly As soon as they saw Pierre and his companion they became silent and Pierre thought he saw the princess hide something as she whisperedI cant bear the sight of that womanCatiche has had tea served in the small drawing room said Prince Vasili to Anna Mikhaylovna Go and take something my poor Anna Mikhaylovna or you will not hold outTo Pierre he said nothing merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeeze below the shoulder Pierre went with Anna Mikhaylovna into the small drawing roomThere is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup of this delicious Russian tea Lorrain was saying with an air of restrained animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate Chinese handleless cup before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid in the small circular room Around the table all who were at Count Bezukhovs house that night had gathered to fortify themselves Pierre well remembered this small circular drawing room with its mirrors and little tables During balls given at the house Pierre who did not know how to dance had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies who as they passed through in their ball dresses with diamonds and pearls on their bare shoulders looked at themselves in the brilliantly lighted mirrors which repeated their reflections several times Now this same room was dimly lighted by two candles On one small table tea things and supper dishes stood in disorder and in the middle of the night a motley throng of people sat there not merrymaking but somberly whispering and betraying by every word and movement that they none of them forgot what was happening and what was about to happen in the bedroom Pierre did not eat anything though he would very much have liked to He looked inquiringly at his monitress and saw that she was again going on tiptoe to the reception room where they had left Prince Vasili and the eldest princess Pierre concluded that this also was essential and after a short interval followed her Anna Mikhaylovna was standing beside the princess and they were both speaking in excited whispersPermit me Princess to know what is necessary and what is not necessary said the younger of the two speakers evidently in the same state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her roomBut my dear princess answered Anna Mikhaylovna blandly but impressively blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other from passing wont this be too much for poor Uncle at a moment when he needs repose Worldly conversation at a moment when his soul is already preparedPrince Vasili was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude with one leg crossed high above the other His cheeks which were so flabby that they looked heavier below were twitching violently but he wore the air of a man little concerned in what the two ladies were sayingCome my dear Anna Mikhaylovna let Catiche do as she pleases You know how fond the count is of herI dont even know what is in this paper said the younger of the two ladies addressing Prince Vasili and pointing to an inlaid portfolio she held in her hand All I know is that his real will is in his writing table and this is a paper he has forgottenShe tried to pass Anna Mikhaylovna but the latter sprang so as to bar her pathI know my dear kind princess said Anna Mikhaylovna seizing the portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily Dear princess I beg and implore you have some pity on him Je vous en conjureThe princess did not reply Their efforts in the struggle for the portfolio were the only sounds audible but it was evident that if the princess did speak her words would not be flattering to Anna Mikhaylovna Though the latter held on tenaciously her voice lost none of its honeyed firmness and softnessPierre my dear come here I think he will not be out of place in a family consultation is it not so PrinceWhy dont you speak cousin suddenly shrieked the princess so loud that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled Why do you remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to interfere making a scene on the very threshold of a dying mans room Intriguer she hissed viciously and tugged with all her might at the portfolioBut Anna Mikhaylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on the portfolio and changed her gripPrince Vasili rose Oh said he with reproach and surprise this is absurd Come let go I tell youThe princess let goAnd you tooBut Anna Mikhaylovna did not obey himLet go I tell you I will take the responsibility I myself will go and ask him I does that satisfy youBut Prince said Anna Mikhaylovna after such a solemn sacrament allow him a moments peace Here Pierre tell them your opinion said she turning to the young man who having come quite close was gazing with astonishment at the angry face of the princess which had lost all dignity and at the twitching cheeks of Prince VasiliRemember that you will answer for the consequences said Prince Vasili severely You dont know what you are doingVile woman shouted the princess darting unexpectedly at Anna Mikhaylovna and snatching the portfolio from herPrince Vasili bent his head and spread out his handsAt this moment that terrible door which Pierre had watched so long and which had always opened so quietly burst noisily open and banged against the wall and the second of the three sisters rushed out wringing her handsWhat are you doing she cried vehemently He is dying and you leave me alone with himHer sister dropped the portfolio Anna Mikhaylovna stooping quickly caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom The eldest princess and Prince Vasili recovering themselves followed her A few minutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard face again biting her underlip At sight of Pierre her expression showed an irrepressible hatredYes now you may be glad said she this is what you have been waiting for And bursting into tears she hid her face in her handkerchief and rushed from the roomPrince Vasili came next He staggered to the sofa on which Pierre was sitting and dropped onto it covering his face with his hand Pierre noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as if in an agueAh my friend said he taking Pierre by the elbow and there was in his voice a sincerity and weakness Pierre had never observed in it before How often we sin how much we deceive and all for what I am near sixty dear friend I too All will end in death all Death is awful and he burst into tearsAnna Mikhaylovna came out last She approached Pierre with slow quiet stepsPierre she saidPierre gave her an inquiring look She kissed the young man on his forehead wetting him with her tears Then after a pause she saidHe is no morePierre looked at her over his spectaclesCome I will go with you Try to weep nothing gives such relief as tearsShe led him into the dark drawing room and Pierre was glad no one could see his face Anna Mikhaylovna left him and when she returned he was fast asleep with his head on his armIn the morning Anna Mikhaylovna said to PierreYes my dear this is a great loss for us all not to speak of you But God will support you you are young and are now I hope in command of an immense fortune The will has not yet been opened I know you well enough to be sure that this will not turn your head but it imposes duties on you and you must be a manPierre was silentPerhaps later on I may tell you my dear boy that if I had not been there God only knows what would have happened You know Uncle promised me only the day before yesterday not to forget Boris But he had no time I hope my dear friend you will carry out your fathers wishPierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in silence at Princess Anna Mikhaylovna After her talk with Pierre Anna Mikhaylovna returned to the Rostovs and went to bed On waking in the morning she told the Rostovs and all her acquaintances the details of Count Bezukhovs death She said the count had died as she would herself wish to die that his end was not only touching but edifying As to the last meeting between father and son it was so touching that she could not think of it without tears and did not know which had behaved better during those awful moments  the father who so remembered everything and everybody at last and last and had spoken such pathetic words to the son or Pierre whom it had been pitiful to see so stricken was he with grief though he tried hard to hide it in order not to sadden his dying father It is painful but it does one good It uplifts the soul to see such men as the old count and his worthy son said she Of the behavior of the eldest princess and Prince Vasili she spoke disapprovingly but in whispers and as a great secret CHAPTER XXV At Bald Hills Prince Nicholas Andreevich Bolkonskis estate the arrival of young Prince Andrew and his wife was daily expected but this expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in the old princes household General in Chief Prince Nicholas Andreevich nicknamed in society the King of Prussia ever since the Emperor Paul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously with his daughter Princess Mary and her companion Mademoiselle Bourienne Though in the new reign he was free to return to the capitals he still continued to live in the country remarking that anyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from Moscow to Bald Hills while he himself needed no one and nothing He used to say that there are only two sources of human vice  idleness and superstition and only two virtues  activity and intelligence He himself undertook his daughters education and to develop these two cardinal virtues in her gave her lessons in algebra and geometry till she was twenty and arranged her life so that her whole time was occupied He was himself always occupied writing his memoirs solving problems in higher mathematics turning snuffboxes on a lathe working in the garden or superintending the building that was always going on at his estate As regularity is a prime condition facilitating activity regularity in his household was carried to the highest point of exactitude He always came to table under precisely the same conditions and not only at the same hour but at the same minute With those about him from his daughter to his serfs the prince was sharp and invariably exacting so that without being a hardhearted man he inspired such fear and respect as few hardhearted men would have aroused Although he was in retirement and had now no influence in political affairs every high official appointed to the province in which the princes estate lay considered it his duty to visit him and waited in the lofty antechamber ante chamber just as the architect gardener or Princess Mary did till the prince appeared punctually to the appointed hour Everyone sitting in this antechamber experienced the same feeling of respect and even fear when the enormously high study door opened and showed the figure of a rather small old man with powdered wig small withered hands and bushy gray eyebrows which when he frowned sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewd youthfully glittering eyesOn the morning of the day that the young couple were to arrive Princess Mary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed for the morning greeting crossing herself with trepidation and repeating a silent prayer Every morning she came in like that and every morning prayed that the daily interview might pass off wellAn old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rose quietly and said in a whisper Please walk inThrough the door came the regular hum of a lathe The princess timidly opened the door which moved noiselessly and easily She paused at the entrance The prince was working at the lathe and after glancing round continued his workThe enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use The large table covered with books and plans the tall glassfronted bookcases with keys in the locks the high desk for writing while standing up on which lay an open exercise book and the lathe with tools laid ready to hand and shavings scattered around  all indicated continuous varied and orderly activity The motion of the small foot shod in a Tartar boot embroidered with silver and the firm pressure of the lean sinewy hand showed that the prince still possessed the tenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old age After a few more turns of the lathe he removed his foot from the pedal wiped his chisel dropped it into a leather pouch attached to the lathe and approaching the table summoned his daughter He never gave his children a blessing so he simply held out his bristly cheek as yet unshaven and regarding her tenderly and attentively said severelyQuite well All right then sit down He took the exercise book containing lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up a chair with his footFor tomorrow said he quickly finding the page and making a scratch from one paragraph to another with his hard nailThe princess bent over the exercise book on the tableWait a bit heres a letter for you said the old man suddenly taking a letter addressed in a womans hand from a bag hanging above the table onto which he threw itAt the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on the princess face She took it quickly and bent her head over itFrom Heloise asked the prince with a cold smile that showed his still sound yellowish teethYes its from Julie replied the princess with a timid glance and a timid smileIll let two more letters pass but the third Ill read said the prince sternly Im afraid you write much nonsense Ill read the thirdRead this if you like Father said the princess blushing still more and holding out the letterThe third I said the third cried the prince abruptly pushing the letter away and leaning his elbows on the table he drew toward him the exercise book containing geometrical figuresWell madam he began stooping over the book close to his daughter and placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she sat so that she felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent of old age and tobacco which she had known so long Now madam these triangles are equal please note that the angle ABCThe princess looked in a scared way at her fathers eyes glittering close to her the red patches on her face came and went and it was plain that she understood nothing and was so frightened that her fear would prevent her understanding any of her fathers further explanations however clear they might be Whether it was the teachers fault or the pupils this same thing happened every day the princess eyes grew dim she could not see and could not hear anything but was only conscious of her stern fathers withered face close to her of his breath and the smell of him and could think only of how to get away quickly to her own room to make out the problem in peace The old man was beside himself moved the chair on which he was sitting noisily backward and forward made efforts to control himself and not become vehement but almost always did become vehement scolded and sometimes flung the exercise book awayThe princess gave a wrong answerWell now isnt she a fool shouted the prince pushing the book aside and turning sharply away but rising immediately he paced up and down lightly touched his daughters hair and sat down againHe drew up his chair and continued to explainThis wont do Princess it wont do said he when Princess Mary having taken and closed the exercise book with the next days lesson was about to leave Mathematics are most important madam I dont want to have you like our silly ladies Get used to it and youll like it and he patted her cheek It will drive all the nonsense out of your headShe turned to go but he stopped her with a gesture and took an uncut book from the high deskHere is some sort of Key to the Mysteries that your Heloise has sent you Religious I dont interfere with anyones belief I have looked at it Take it Well now go GoHe patted her on the shoulder and himself closed the door after herPrincess Mary went back to her room with the sad scared expression that rarely left her and which made her plain sickly face yet plainer She sat down at her writing table on which stood miniature portraits and which was littered with books and papers The princess was as untidy as her father was tidy She put down the geometry book and eagerly broke the seal of her letter It was from her most intimate friend from childhood that same Julie Karagina who had been at the Rostovs nameday partyJulie wrote in French Dear and precious Friend How terrible and frightful a thing is separation Though I tell myself that half my life and half my happiness are wrapped up in you and that in spite of the distance separating us our hearts are united by indissoluble bonds my heart rebels against fate and in spite of the pleasures and distractions around me I cannot overcome a certain secret sorrow that has been in my heart ever since we parted Why are we not together as we were last summer in your big study on the blue sofa the confidential sofa Why cannot I now as three months ago draw fresh moral strength from your look so gentle calm and penetrating a look I loved so well and seem to see before me as I write Having read thus far Princess Mary sighed and glanced into the mirror which stood on her right It reflected a weak ungraceful figure and thin face Her eyes always sad now looked with particular hopelessness at her reflection in the glass She flatters me thought the princess turning away and continuing to read But Julie did not flatter her friend the princess eyes  large deep and luminous it seemed as if at times there radiated from them shafts of warm light  were so beautiful that very often in spite of the plainness of her face they gave her an attraction more powerful than that of beauty But the princess never saw the beautiful expression of her own eyes  the look they had when she was not thinking of herself As with everyone her face assumed a forced unnatural expression as soon as she looked in a glass She went on reading All Moscow talks of nothing but war One of my two brothers is already abroad the other is with the Guards who are starting on their march to the frontier Our dear Emperor has left Petersburg and it is thought intends to expose his precious person to the chances of war God grant that the Corsican monster who is destroying the peace of Europe may be overthrown by the angel whom it has pleased the Almighty in His goodness to give us as sovereign To say nothing of my brothers this war has deprived me of one of the associations nearest my heart I mean young Nicholas Rostov who with his enthusiasm could not bear to remain inactive and has left the university to join the army I will confess to you dear Mary that in spite of his extreme youth his departure for the army was a great grief to me This young man of whom I spoke to you last summer is so nobleminded and full of that real youthfulness which one seldom finds nowadays among our old men of twenty and particularly he is so frank and has so much heart He is so pure and poetic that my relations with him transient as they were have been one of the sweetest comforts to my poor heart which has already suffered so much Someday I will tell you about our parting and all that was said then That is still too fresh Ah dear friend you are happy not to know these poignant joys and sorrows You are fortunate for the latter are generally the stronger I know very well that Count Nicholas is too young ever to be more to me than a friend but this sweet friendship this poetic and pure intimacy were what my heart needed But enough of this The chief news about which all Moscow gossips is the death of old Count Bezukhov and his inheritance Fancy The three princesses have received very little Prince Vasili nothing and it is Monsieur Pierre who has inherited all the property and has besides been recognized as legitimate so that he is now Count Bezukhov and possessor of the finest fortune in Russia It is rumored that Prince Vasili played a very despicable part in this affair and that he returned to Petersburg quite crestfallenI confess I understand very little about all these matters of wills and inheritance but I do know that since this young man whom we all used to know as plain Monsieur Pierre has become Count Bezukhov and the owner of one of the largest fortunes in Russia I am much amused to watch the change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened by marriageable daughters and of the young ladies themselves toward him though between you and me he always seemed to me a poor sort of fellow As for the past two years people have amused themselves by finding husbands for me most of whom I dont even know the matchmaking chronicles of Moscow now speak of me as the future Countess Bezukhova But you will understand that I have no desire for the post A propos of marriages do you know that a while ago that universal auntie Anna Mikhaylovna told me under the seal of strict secrecy of a plan of marriage for you It is neither more nor less than with Prince Vasilis son Anatole whom they wish to reform by marrying him to someone rich and distinguee and it is on you that his relations choice has fallen I dont know what you will think of it but I consider it my duty to let you know of it He is said to be very handsome and a terrible scapegrace That is all I have been able to find out about himBut enough of gossip I am at the end of my second sheet of paper and Mamma has sent for me to go and dine at the Apraksins Read the mystical book I am sending you it has an enormous success here Though there are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to grasp it is an admirable book which calms and elevates the soul Adieu Give my respects to monsieur your father and my compliments to Mademoiselle Bourienne I embrace you as I love you JULIEPS Let me have news of your brother and his charming little wife The princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and her luminous eyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed Then she suddenly rose and with her heavy tread went up to the table She took a sheet of paper and her hand moved rapidly over it This is the reply she wrote also in French Dear and precious Friend Your letter of the th has given me great delight So you still love me my romantic Julie Separation of which you say so much that is bad does not seem to have had its usual effect on you You complain of our separation What then should I say if I dared complain I who am deprived of all who are dear to me Ah if we had not religion to console us life would be very sad Why do you suppose that I should look severely on your affection for that young man On such matters I am only severe with myself I understand such feelings in others and if never having felt them I cannot approve of them neither do I condemn them Only it seems to me that Christian love love of ones neighbor love of ones enemy is worthier sweeter and better than the feelings which the beautiful eyes of a young man can inspire in a romantic and loving young girl like yourselfThe news of Count Bezukhovs death reached us before your letter and my father was much affected by it He says the count was the last representative but one of the great century and that it is his own turn now but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as late as possible God preserve us from that terrible misfortuneI cannot agree with you about Pierre whom I knew as a child He always seemed to me to have an excellent heart and that is the quality I value most in people As to his inheritance and the part played by Prince Vasili it is very sad for both Ah my dear friend our divine Saviours words that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God are terribly true I pity Prince Vasili but am still more sorry for Pierre So young and burdened with such riches  to what temptations he will be exposed If I were asked what I desire most on earth it would be to be poorer than the poorest beggar A thousand thanks dear friend for the volume you have sent me and which has such success in Moscow Yet since you tell me that among some good things it contains others which our weak human understanding cannot grasp it seems to me rather useless to spend time in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear no fruit I never could understand the fondness some people have for confusing their minds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken their doubts and excite their imagination giving them a bent for exaggeration quite contrary to Christian simplicity Let us rather read the Epistles and Gospels Let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries they contain for how can we miserable sinners that we are know the terrible and holy secrets of Providence while we remain in this flesh which forms an impenetrable veil between us and the Eternal Let us rather confine ourselves to studying those sublime rules which our divine Saviour has left for our guidance here below Let us try to conform to them and follow them and let us be persuaded that the less we let our feeble human minds roam the better we shall please God who rejects all knowledge that does not come from Him and the less we seek to fathom what He has been pleased to conceal from us the sooner will He vouchsafe its revelation to us through His divine SpiritMy father has not spoken to me of a suitor but has only told me that he has received a letter and is expecting a visit from Prince Vasili In regard to this project of marriage for me I will tell you dear sweet friend that I look on marriage as a divine institution to which we must conform However painful it may be to me should the Almighty lay the duties of wife and wife and mother upon me I shall try to perform them as faithfully as I can without disquieting myself by examining my feelings toward him whom He may give me for husbandI have had a letter from my brother who announces his speedy arrival at Bald Hills with his wife This pleasure will be but a brief one however for he will leave us again to take part in this unhappy war into which we have been drawn God knows how or why Not only where you are  at the heart of affairs and of the world  is the talk all of war even here amid fieldwork and the calm of nature  which townsfolk consider characteristic of the country  rumors of war are heard and painfully felt My father talks of nothing but marches and countermarches things of which I understand nothing and the day before yesterday during my daily walk through the village I witnessed a heartrending scene It was a convoy of conscripts enrolled from our people and starting to join the army You should have seen the state of the mothers wives and children of the men who were going and should have heard the sobs It seems as though mankind has forgotten the laws of its divine Saviour Who preached love and forgiveness of injuries  and that men attribute the greatest merit to skill in killing one anotherAdieu dear and kind friend may our divine Saviour and His most Holy Mother keep you in their holy and allpowerful care MARY Ah you are sending off a letter Princess I have already dispatched mine I have written to my poor mother said the smiling Mademoiselle Bourienne rapidly in her pleasant mellow tones and with guttural rs She brought into Princess Marys strenuous mournful and gloomy world a quite different atmosphere careless lighthearted and selfsatisfiedPrincess I must warn you she added lowering her voice and evidently listening to herself with pleasure and speaking with exaggerated grasseyement the prince has been scolding Michael Ivanovich He is in a very bad humor very morose Be preparedAh dear friend replied Princess Mary I have asked you never to warn me of the humor my father is in I do not allow myself to judge him and would not have others do soThe princess glanced at her watch and seeing that she was five minutes late in starting her practice on the clavichord went into the sitting room with a look of alarm Between twelve and two oclock as the day was mapped out the prince rested and the princess played the clavichord CHAPTER XXVI The grayhaired valet was sitting drowsily listening to the snoring of the prince who was in his large study From the far side of the house through the closed doors came the sound of difficult passages  twenty times repeated  of a sonata by DussekJust then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to the porch Prince Andrew got out of the carriage helped his little wife to alight and let her pass into the house before him Old Tikhon wearing a wig put his head out of the door of the antechamber reported in a whisper that the prince was sleeping and hastily closed the door Tikhon knew that neither the sons arrival nor any other unusual event must be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the day Prince Andrew apparently knew this as well as Tikhon he looked at his watch as if to ascertain whether his fathers habits had changed since he was at home last and having assured himself that they had not he turned to his wifeHe will get up in twenty minutes Let us go across to Marys room he saidThe little princess had grown stouter during this time but her eyes and her short downy smiling lip lifted when she began to speak just as merrily and prettily as everWhy this is a palace she said to her husband looking around with the expression with which people compliment their host at a ball Lets come quick quick And with a glance round she smiled at Tikhon at her husband and at the footman who accompanied themIs that Mary practicing Lets go quietly and take her by surprisePrince Andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expressionYouve grown older Tikhon he said in passing to the old man who kissed his handBefore they reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichord came the pretty fair haired Frenchwoman Mademoiselle Bourienne rushed out apparently beside herself with delightAh what joy for the princess exclaimed she At last I must let her knowNo no please not You are Mademoiselle Bourienne said the little princess kissing her I know you already through my sisterinlaws friendship for you She was not expecting usThey went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the sound of the oftrepeated passage of the sonata Prince Andrew stopped and made a grimace as if expecting something unpleasantThe little princess entered the room The passage broke off in the middle a cry was heard then Princess Marys heavy tread and the sound of kissing When Prince Andrew went in the two princesses who had only met once before for a short time at his wedding were in each others arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they happened to touch Mademoiselle Bourienne stood near them pressing her hand to her heart with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to cry or to laugh Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned as lovers of music do when they hear a false note The two women let go of one another and then as if afraid of being too late seized each others hands kissing them and pulling them away and again began kissing each other on the face and then to Prince Andrews surprise both began to cry and kissed again Mademoiselle Bourienne also began to cry Prince Andrew evidently felt ill at ease but to the two women it seemed quite natural that they should cry and apparently it never entered their heads that it could have been otherwise at this meetingAh my dear Ah Mary they suddenly exclaimed and then laughed I dreamed last night  You were not expecting us  Ah Mary you have got thinner And you have grown stouterI knew the princess at once put in Mademoiselle BourienneAnd I had no idea exclaimed Princess Mary Ah Andrew I did not see youPrince Andrew and his sister hand in hand kissed one another and he told her she was still the same crybaby as ever Princess Mary had turned toward her brother and through her tears the loving warm gentle look of her large luminous eyes very beautiful at that moment rested on Prince Andrews faceThe little princess talked incessantly her short downy upper lip continually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary and drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of glittering teeth and sparkling eyes She told of an accident they had had on the Spasski Hill which might have been serious for her in her condition and immediately after that informed them that she had left all her clothes in Petersburg and that heaven knew what she would have to dress in here and that Andrew had quite changed and that Kitty Odyntsova had married an old man and that there was a suitor for Mary a real one but that they would talk of that later Princess Mary was still looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full of love and sadness It was plain that she was following a train of thought independent of her sisterinlaws words In the midst of a description of the last Petersburg fete she addressed her brotherSo you are really going to the war Andrew she said sighingLise sighed tooYes and even tomorrow replied her brotherHe is leaving me here God knows why when he might have had promotionPrincess Mary did not listen to the end but continuing her train of thought turned to her sisterinlaw with a tender glance at her figureIs it certain she saidThe face of the little princess changed She sighed and said Yes quite certain Ah it is very dreadfulHer lip descended She brought her face close to her sisterinlaws and unexpectedly again began to cryShe needs rest said Prince Andrew with a frown Dont you Lise Take her to your room and Ill go to Father How is he Just the sameYes just the same Though I dont know what your opinion will be answered the princess joyfullyAnd are the hours the same And the walks in the avenues And the lathe asked Prince Andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which showed that in spite of all his love and respect for his father he was aware of his weaknessesThe hours are the same and the lathe and also the mathematics and my geometry lessons said Princess Mary gleefully as if her lessons in geometry were among the greatest delights of her lifeWhen the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old prince to get up Tikhon came to call the young prince to his father The old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his sons arrival he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while he dressed for dinner The old prince always dressed in oldfashioned style wearing an antique coat and powdered hair and when Prince Andrew entered his fathers dressing room not with the contemptuous look and manner he wore in drawing rooms but with the animated face with which he talked to Pierre the old man was sitting on a large leathercovered chair wrapped in a powdering mantle entrusting his head to TikhonAh heres the warrior Wants to vanquish Buonaparte said the old man shaking his powdered head as much as the tail which Tikhon was holding fast to plait would allowYou at least must tackle him properly or else if he goes on like this hell soon have us too for his subjects How are you And he held out his cheekThe old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner He used to say that a nap after dinner was silver  before dinner golden He cast happy sidelong glances at his son from under his thick bushy eyebrows Prince Andrew went up and kissed his father on the spot indicated to him He made no reply on his fathers favorite topic  making fun of the military men of the day and more particularly of BonaparteYes Father I have come come to you and brought my wife who is pregnant said Prince Andrew following every movement of his fathers face with an eager and respectful look How is your healthOnly fools and rakes fall ill my boy You know me I am busy from morning till night and abstemious so of course I am wellThank God said his son smilingGod has nothing to do with it Well go on he continued returning to his hobby tell me how the Germans have taught you to fight Bonaparte by this new science you call strategyPrince Andrew smiledGive me time to collect my wits Father said he with a smile that showed that his fathers foibles did not prevent his son from loving and honoring him Why I have not yet had time to settle downNonsense nonsense cried the old man shaking his pigtail to see whether it was firmly plaited and grasping his by the hand The house for your wife is ready Princess Mary will take her there and show her over and theyll talk nineteen to the dozen Thats their womans way I am glad to have her Sit down and talk About Mikhelsons army I understand  Tolstoys too a simultaneous expedition But whats the southern army to do Prussia is neutral I know that What about Austria said he rising from his chair and pacing up and down the room followed by Tikhon who ran after him handing him different articles of clothing What of Sweden How will they cross PomeraniaPrince Andrew seeing that his father insisted began  at first reluctantly but gradually with more and more animation and from habit changing unconsciously from Russian to French as he went on  to explain the plan of operation for the coming campaign He explained how an army ninety thousand strong was to threaten Prussia so as to bring her out of her neutrality and draw her into the war how part of that army was to join some Swedish forces at Stralsund how two hundred and twenty thousand Austrians with a hundred thousand Russians were to operate in Italy and on the Rhine how fifty thousand Russians and as many English were to land at Naples and how a total force of five hundred thousand men was to attack the French from different sides The old prince did not evince the least interest during this explanation but as if he were not listening to it continued to dress while walking about and three times unexpectedly interrupted Once he stopped it by shouting The white one the white oneThis meant that Tikhon was not handing him the waistcoat he wanted Another time he interrupted sayingAnd will she soon be confined and shaking his head reproachfully said Thats bad Go on go onThe third interruption came when Prince Andrew was finishing his description The old man began to sing in the cracked voice of old age Malbrook sen vaten guerre Dieu sait quand reviendra Marlborough is going to the wars God knows when hell return His son only smiledI dont say its a plan I approve of said the son I am only telling you what it is Napoleon has also formed his plan by now not worse than this oneWell youve told me nothing new and the old man repeated meditatively and rapidlyDieu sait quand reviendra Go to the dining room CHAPTER XXVII At the appointed hour the prince powdered and shaven entered the dining room where his daughterinlaw Princess Mary and Mademoiselle Bourienne were already awaiting him together with his architect who by a strange caprice of his employers was admitted to table though the position of that insignificant individual was such as could certainly not have caused him to expect that honor The prince who generally kept very strictly to social distinctions and rarely admitted even important government officials to his table had unexpectedly selected Michael Ivanovich who always went into a corner to blow his nose on his checked handkerchief to illustrate the theory that all men are equals and had more than once impressed on his daughter that Michael Ivanovich was not a whit worse than you or I At dinner the prince usually spoke to the taciturn Michael Ivanovich more often than to anyone elseIn the dining room which like all the rooms in the house was exceedingly lofty the members of the household and the footmen  one behind each chair  stood waiting for the prince to enter The head butler napkin on arm was scanning the setting of the table making signs to the footmen and anxiously glancing from the clock to the door by which the prince was to enter Prince Andrew was looking at a large gilt frame new to him containing the genealogical tree of the Princes Bolkonski opposite which hung another such frame with a badly painted portrait evidently by the hand of the artist belonging to the estate of a ruling prince in a crown  an alleged descendant of Rurik and ancestor of the Bolkonskis Prince Andrew looking again at that genealogical tree shook his head laughing as a man laughs who looks at a portrait so characteristic of the original as to be amusingHow thoroughly like him that is he said to Princess Mary who had come up to himPrincess Mary looked at her brother in surprise She did not understand what he was laughing at Everything her father did inspired her with reverence and was beyond questionEveryone has his Achilles heel continued Prince Andrew Fancy with his powerful mind indulging in such nonsensePrincess Mary could not understand the boldness of her brothers criticism and was about to reply when the expected footsteps were heard coming from the study The prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was his wont as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners with the strict formality of his house At that moment the great clock struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing room The prince stood still his lively glittering eyes from under their thick bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested on the little princess She felt as courtiers do when the Tsar enters the sensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all around him He stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly on the back of her neckIm glad glad to see you he said looking attentively into her eyes and then quickly went to his place and sat down Sit down sit down Sit down Michael IanovichHe indicated a place beside him to his daughterinlaw A footman moved the chair for herHo ho said the old man casting his eyes on her rounded figure Youve been in a hurry Thats badHe laughed in his usual dry cold unpleasant way with his lips only and not with his eyesYou must walk walk as much as possible as much as possible he saidThe little princess did not or did not wish to hear his words She was silent and seemed confused The prince asked her about her father and she began to smile and talk He asked about mutual acquaintances and she became still more animated and chattered away giving him greetings from various people and retailing the town gossipCountess Apraksina poor thing has lost her husband and she has cried her eyes out she said growing more and more livelyAs she became animated the prince looked at her more and more sternly and suddenly as if he had studied her sufficiently and had formed a definite idea of her he turned away and addressed Michael IvanovichWell Michael Ivanovich our Bonaparte will be having a bad time of it Prince Andrew he always spoke thus of his son has been telling me what forces are being collected against him While you and I never thought much of himMichael Ivanovich did not at all know when you and I had said such things about Bonaparte but understanding that he was wanted as a peg on which to hang the princes favorite topic he looked inquiringly at the young prince wondering what would followHe is a great tactician said the prince to his son pointing to the architectAnd the conversation again turned on the war on Bonaparte and the generals and statesmen of the day The old prince seemed convinced not only that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the A B C of war or of politics and that Bonaparte was an insignificant little Frenchy successful only because there were no longer any Potemkins or Suvorovs left to oppose him but he was also convinced that there were no political difficulties in Europe and no real war but only a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day were playing pretending to do something real Prince Andrew gaily bore with his fathers ridicule of the new men and drew him on and listened to him with evident pleasureThe past always seems good said he but did not Suvorov himself fall into a trap Moreau set him and from which he did not know how to escapeWho told you that Who cried the prince Suvorov And he jerked away his plate which Tikhon briskly caught Suvorov Consider Prince Andrew Two Frederick and Suvorov Moreau Moreau would have been a prisoner if Suvorov had had a free hand but he had the HofskriegswurstschnappsRath on his hands It would have puzzled the devil himself When you get there youll find out what those HofskriegswurstRaths are Suvorov couldnt manage them so what chance has Michael Kutuzov No my dear boy he continued you and your generals wont get on against Buonaparte youll have to call in the French so that birds of a feather may fight together The German Pahlen has been sent to New York in America to fetch the Frenchman Moreau he said alluding to the invitation made that year to Moreau to enter the Russian service Wonderful Were the Potemkins Suvorovs and Orlovs Germans No lad either you fellows have all lost your wits or I have outlived mine May God help you but well see what will happen Buonaparte has become a great commander among them HmI dont at all say that all the plans are good said Prince Andrew I am only surprised at your opinion of Bonaparte You may laugh as much as you like but all the same Bonaparte is a great generallMichael Ivanovich cried the old prince to the architect who busy with his roast meat hoped he had been forgotten Didnt I tell you Buonaparte was a great tactician Here he says same thingTo be sure your excellency replied the architectThe prince again laughed his frigid laughBuonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth He has got splendid soldiers Besides he began by attacking Germans And only idlers have failed to beat the Germans Since the world began everybody has beaten the Germans They beat no one  except one another He made his reputation fighting themAnd the prince began explaining all the blunders which according to him Bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics His son made no rejoinder but it was evident that whatever arguments were presented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion He listened refraining from a reply and involuntarily wondered how this old man living alone in the country for so many years could know and discuss so minutely and acutely all the recent European military and political eventsYou think Im an old man and dont understand the present state of affairs concluded his father But it troubles me I dont sleep at night Come now where has this great commander of yours shown his skill he concludedThat would take too long to tell answered the sonWell then go to your Buonaparte Mademoiselle Bourienne heres another admirer of that powdermonkey emperor of yours he exclaimed in excellent FrenchYou know Prince I am not a BonapartistDieu sait quand reviendra hummed the prince out of tune and with a laugh still more so he quitted the tableThe little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of the dinner sat silent glancing with a frightened look now at her fatherinlaw and now at Princess Mary When they left the table she took her sisterinlaws arm and drew her into another roomWhat a clever man your father is said she perhaps that is why I am afraid of himOh he is so kind answered Princess Mary CHAPTER XXVIII Prince Andrew was to leave next evening The old prince not altering his routine retired as usual after dinner The little princess was in her sisterinlaws room Prince Andrew in a traveling coat without epaulettes had been packing with his valet in the rooms assigned to him After inspecting the carriage himself and seeing the trunks put in he ordered the horses to be harnessed Only those things he always kept with him remained in his room a small box a large canteen fitted with silver plate two Turkish pistols and a saber  a present from his father who had brought it from the siege of Ochakov All these traveling effects of Prince Andrews were in very good order new clean and in cloth covers carefully tied with tapesWhen starting on a journey or changing their mode of life men capable of reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind At such moments one reviews the past and plans for the future Prince Andrews face looked very thoughtful and tender With his hands behind him he paced briskly from corner to corner of the room looking straight before him and thoughtfully shaking his head Did he fear going to the war or was he sad at leaving his wife  perhaps both but evidently he did not wish to be seen in that mood for hearing footsteps in the passage he hurriedly unclasped his hands stopped at a table as if tying the cover of the small box and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrable expression It was the heavy tread of Princess Mary that he heardI hear you have given orders to harness she cried panting she had apparently been running and I did so wish to have another talk with you alone God knows how long we may again be parted You are not angry with me for coming You have changed so Andrusha she added as if to explain such a questionShe smiled as she uttered his pet name Andrusha It was obviously strange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be Andrusha  the slender mischievous boy who had been her playfellow in childhoodAnd where is Lise he asked answering her question only by a smileShe was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room Oh Andrew What a treasure of a wife you have said she sitting down on the sofa facing her brother She is quite a child such a dear merry child I have grown so fond of herPrince Andrew was silent but the princess noticed the ironical and contemptuous look that showed itself on his faceOne must be indulgent to little weaknesses who is free from them Andrew Dont forget that she has grown up and been educated in society and so her position now is not a rosy one We should enter into everyones situation Tout comprendre cest tout pardonner Think it must be for her poor thing after what she has been used to to be parted from her husband and be left alone the country in her condition Its very hard To understand all is to forgive all Prince Andrew smiled as he looked at his sister as we smile at those we think we thoroughly understandYou live in the country and dont think the life terrible he repliedI thats different Why speak of me I dont want any other life and cant for I know no other But think Andrew for a young society woman to be buried in the country during the best years of her life all alone  for Papa is always busy and I well you know what poor resources I have for entertaining a woman used to the best society There is only Mademoiselle BourienneI dont like your Mademoiselle Bourienne at all said Prince AndrewNo She is very nice and kind and above all shes much to be pitied She has no one no one To tell the truth I dont need her and shes even in my way You know I always was a savage and now am even more so I like being alone Father likes her very much She and Michael Ivanovich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and kind because he has been a benefactor to them both As Sterne says We dont love people so much for the good they have done us as for the good we have done them Father took her when she was homeless after losing her own father She is very goodnatured and my father likes her way of reading She reads to him in the evenings and reads splendidlyTo be quite frank Mary I expect Fathers character sometimes makes things trying for you doesnt it Prince Andrew asked suddenlyPrincess Mary was first surprised and then aghast at this questionFor me For me Trying for me said sheHe always was rather harsh and now I should think hes getting very trying said Prince Andrew apparently speaking lightly of their father in order to puzzle or test his sisterYou are good in every way Andrew but you have a kind of intellectual pride said the princess following the train of her own thoughts rather than the trend of the conversation  and thats a great sin How can one judge Father But even if one might what feeling except veneration could such a man as my father evoke And I am so contented and happy with him I only wish you were all as happy as I amHer brother shook his head incredulouslyThe only thing that is hard for me I will tell you the truth Andrew is Fathers way of treating religious subjects I dont understand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what is as clear as day and can go so far astray That is the only thing that makes me unhappy But even in this I can see lately a shade of improvement His satire has been less bitter of late and there was a monk he received and had a long talk withAh my dear I am afraid you and your monk are wasting your powder said Prince Andrew banteringly yet tenderlyAh mon ami I only pray and hope that God will hear me Andrew she said timidly after a moments silence I have a great favor to ask of youWhat is it dearNo  promise that you will not refuse It will give you no trouble and is nothing unworthy of you but it will comfort me Promise Andrusha said she putting her hand in her reticule but not yet taking out what she was holding inside it as if what she held were the subject of her request and must not be shown before the request was grantedShe looked timidly at her brotherEven if it were a great deal of trouble answered Prince Andrew as if guessing what it was aboutThink what you please I know you are just like Father Think as you please but do this for my sake Please do Fathers father our grandfather wore it in all his wars She still did not take out what she was holding in her reticule So you promiseOf course What is itAndrew I bless you with this icon and you must promise me you will never take it off Do you promiseIf it does not weigh a hundredweight and wont break my neck To please you said Prince Andrew But immediately noticing the pained expression his joke had brought to his sisters face he repented and added I am glad really dear I am very gladAgainst your will He will save and have mercy on you and bring you to Himself for in Him alone is truth and peace said she in a voice trembling with emotion solemnly holding up in both hands before her brother a small oval antique darkfaced icon of the Saviour in a gold setting on a finely wrought silver chainShe crossed herself kissed the icon and handed it to AndrewPlease Andrew for my sakeRays of gentle light shone from her large timid eyes Those eyes lit up the whole of her thin sickly face and made it beautiful Her brother would have taken the icon but she stopped him Andrew understood crossed himself and kissed the icon There was a look of tenderness for he was touched but also a gleam of irony on his faceThank you my dear She kissed him on the forehead and sat down again on the sofa They were silent for a whileAs I was saying to you Andrew be kind and generous as you always used to be Dont judge Lise harshly she began She is so sweet so goodnatured and her position now is a very hard oneI do not think I have complained of my wife to you Masha or blamed her Why do you say all this to meRed patches appeared on Princess Marys face and she was silent as if she felt guiltyI have said nothing to you but you have already been talked to And I am sorry for that he went onThe patches grew deeper on her forehead neck and cheeks She tried to say something but could not Her brother had guessed right the little princess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her forebodings about her confinement and how she dreaded it and had complained of her fate her fatherinlaw and her husband After crying she had fallen asleep Prince Andrew felt sorry for his sisterKnow this Masha I cant reproach have not reproached and never shall reproach my wife with anything and I cannot reproach myself with anything in regard to her and that always will be so in whatever circumstances I may be placed But if you want to know the truth if you want to know whether I am happy No Is she happy No But why this is so I dont knowAs he said this he rose went to his sister and stooping kissed her forehead His fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful kindly and unaccustomed brightness but he was looking not at his sister but over her head toward the darkness of the open doorwayLet us go to her I must say goodby Or  go and wake and Ill come in a moment Petrushka he called to his valet Come here take these away Put this on the seat and this to the rightPrincess Mary rose and moved to the door then stopped and said Andrew if you had faith you would have turned to God and asked Him to give you the love you do not feel and your prayer would have been answeredWell may be said Prince Andrew Go Masha Ill come immediatelyOn the way to his sisters room in the passage which connected one wing with the other Prince Andrew met Mademoiselle Bourienne smiling sweetly It was the third time that day that with an ecstatic and artless smile she had met him in secluded passagesOh I thought you were in your room she said for some reason blushing and dropping her eyesPrince Andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger suddenly came over his face He said nothing to her but looked at her forehead and hair without looking at her eyes with such contempt that the Frenchwoman blushed and went away without a word When he reached his sisters room his wife was already awake and her merry voice hurrying one word after another came through the open door She was speaking as usual in French and as if after long selfrestraint she wished to make up for lost timeNo but imagine the old Countess Zubova with false curls and her mouth full of false teeth as if she were trying to cheat old age Ha ha ha MaryThis very sentence about Countess Zubova and this same laugh Prince Andrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of others some five times He entered the room softly The little princess plump and rosy was sitting in an easy chair with her work in her hands talking incessantly repeating Petersburg reminiscences and even phrases Prince Andrew came up stroked her hair and asked if she felt rested after their journey She answered him and continued her chatterThe coach with six horses was waiting at the porch It was an autumn night so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole Servants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch The immense house was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows The domestic serfs were crowding in the hall waiting to bid goodby to the young prince The members of the household were all gathered in the reception hall Michael Ivanovich Mademoiselle Bourienne Princess Mary and the little princess Prince Andrew had been called to his fathers study as the latter wished to say goodby to him alone All were waiting for them to come outWhen Prince Andrew entered the study the old man in his oldage spectacles and white dressing gown in which he received no one but his son sat at the table writing He glanced roundGoing And he went on writingIve come to say goodbyKiss me here and he touched his cheek Thanks thanksWhat do you thank me forFor not dillydallying and not hanging to a womans apron strings The Service before everything Thanks thanks And he went on writing so that his quill spluttered and squeaked If you have anything to say say it These two things can be done together he addedAbout my wife I am ashamed as it is to leave her on your handsWhy talk nonsense Say what you wantWhen her confinement is due send to Moscow for an accoucheur Let him be hereThe old prince stopped writing and as if not understanding fixed his stern eyes on his sonI know that no one can help if nature does not do her work said Prince Andrew evidently confused I know that out of a million cases only one goes wrong but it is her fancy and mine They have been telling her things She has had a dream and is frightenedHm Hm muttered the old prince to himself finishing what he was writing Ill do itHe signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to laughIts a bad business ehWhat is bad FatherThe wife said the old prince briefly and significantlyI dont understand said Prince AndrewNo it cant be helped lad said the prince Theyre all like that one cant unmarry Dont be afraid I wont tell anyone but you know it yourselfHe seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers shook it looked straight into his sons face with keen eyes which seemed to see through him and again laughed his frigid laughThe son sighed thus admitting that his father had understood him The old man continued to fold and seal his letter snatching up and throwing down the wax the seal and the paper with his accustomed rapidityWhats to be done Shes pretty I will do everything Make your mind easy said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letterAndrew did not speak he was both pleased and displeased that his father understood him The old man got up and gave the letter to his sonListen said he dont worry about your wife what can be done shall be Now listen Give this letter to Michael Ilarionovich I have written that he should make use of you in proper places and not keep you long as an adjutant a bad position Tell him I remember and like him Write and tell me how he receives you If he is all right  serve him Nicholas Bolkonskis son need not serve under anyone if he is in disfavor Now come here Kutuzov He spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words but his son was accustomed to understand him He led him to the desk raised the lid drew out a drawer and took out an exercise book filled with his bold tall close handwritingI shall probably die before you So remember these are my memoirs hand them to the Emperor after my death Now here is a Lombard bond and a letter it is a premium for the man who writes a history of Suvorovs wars Send it to the Academy Here are some jottings for you to read when I am gone You will find them usefulAndrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long time yet He felt that he must not say itI will do it all Father he saidWell now goodby He gave his son his hand to kiss and embraced him Remember this Prince Andrew if they kill you it will hurt me your old father he paused unexpectedly and then in a querulous voice suddenly shrieked but if I hear that you have not behaved like a son of Nicholas Bolkonski I shall be ashamedYou need not have said that to me Father said the son with a smileThe old man was silentI also wanted to ask you continued Prince Andrew if Im killed and if I have a son do not let him be taken away from you  as I said yesterday let him grow up with you PleaseNot let the wife have him said the old man and laughedThey stood silent facing one another The old mans sharp eyes were fixed straight on his sons Something twitched in the lower part of the old princes faceWeve said goodby Go he suddenly shouted in a loud angry voice opening his doorWhat is it What asked both princesses when they saw for a moment at the door Prince Andrew and the figure of the old man in a white dressing gown spectacled and wigless shouting in an angry voicePrince Andrew sighed and made no replyWell he said turning to his wifeAnd this Well sounded coldly ironic as if he were saying Now go through your performanceAndrew already said the little princess turning pale and looking with dismay at her husbandHe embraced her She screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulderHe cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on looked into her face and carefully placed her in an easy chairAdieu Mary said he gently to his sister taking her by the hand and kissing her and then he left the room with rapid stepsThe little princess lay in the armchair Mademoiselle Bourienne chafing her temples Princess Mary supporting her sisterinlaw still looked with her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which Prince Andrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his direction From the study like pistol shots came the frequent sound of the old man angrily blowing his nose Hardly had Prince Andrew gone when the study door opened quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the white dressing gown looked outGone Thats all right said he and looking angrily at the unconscious little princess he shook his head reprovingly and slammed the door
